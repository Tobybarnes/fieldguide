# Week 2: Before You Begin

*This is Guide 01 of Field Guide—still free for everyone. If you missed last week's introduction, start there to understand what we're doing and why it matters.*

*This week is about mindset. About what you're actually learning to do, and what you're not.*

---

This is about capability, not credentials. When you have an idea—a tool that would make your life easier, a system that fits how you actually think, a thing that exists only in your mind—you can just make it.

You make it to have it. To use it. To own something you built with your own hands.

When you finish this guide, you'll just be someone who makes what they need.

## Escaping the Cage

Gary Snyder wrote: "Three-fourths of philosophy and literature is the talk of people trying to convince themselves that they really like the cage they were tricked into entering."

The cage, in tech, is: you must use what's built for you. Subscribe to services. Adapt to platforms. Let companies decide what features matter.

Most people accept this. They complain about software, but they don't imagine alternatives. They assume building is for professionals.

Field Guide teaches you to step out of that cage. Not because you're special—because it's actually possible now. Claude removes the technical barrier that kept building walled off.

The cage exists in your mind. You believe you can't make what you need.

Snyder spent decades living in the mountains, building his own house, growing food, writing poetry. Self-reliance through skill and attention. He chose which parts of civilization to engage with on his own terms.

You can do the same with technology. Build what serves you. Ignore what doesn't. Choose your tools deliberately instead of accepting what's marketed to you.

## What This Actually Means

Programming is a skill—syntax, patterns, best practices, computer science fundamentals. It takes years to get good at it.

Building is a practice. You describe something, you see it exist, you refine it until it works. The loop is fast. The barrier is low. You develop taste and clarity about what you want.

Claude writes the code. You direct it. You test what it makes. You ask for changes. You develop judgment about what works and what doesn't.

This is new. Five years ago, if you wanted a custom tool, you had two options: learn to code (months or years of effort) or hire someone (expensive, slow, you lose control). Now there's a third way: describe it clearly enough that Claude can build it.

## On Using AI Thoughtfully

Before going further, let's address the concerns you might have about using AI.

### The Environmental Cost

Training large language models requires significant energy. This is real. Data centers consume resources. The environmental impact matters.

Context: The AI models already exist. Using Claude to build nine personal tools over 13 weeks uses a tiny fraction of the energy that went into training the model—comparable to a few dozen Google searches. Billions of people use AI for casual queries daily. Your focused use to build tools that reduce your dependence on extractive platforms is directionally better.

This doesn't make the environmental cost disappear. But if AI exists and you can't personally stop it, using it to reclaim agency over your digital life seems like one of the more thoughtful applications.

### Labor and Displacement

AI tools are built on human labor—both the engineers who create them and the human work that trains them. Concerns about job displacement in creative and technical fields are legitimate.

This course teaches you to build personal tools for yourself, not to replace human workers or launch products that compete with people's livelihoods. The intent matters.

There's a difference between:
- Using AI to build nine small tools for your actual life
- Using AI to generate content at scale for profit
- Using AI to replace human craftspeople

Field Guide sits in the first category. You're building for yourself. No extraction. No scale. No replacement of human work.

### Copyright and Training Data

AI models are trained on vast amounts of text, code, and creative work—much of it copyrighted. The ethics of this are contested and evolving through courts and policy.

What you're building: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following documented standards and common patterns. The code Claude generates for personal tools isn't copying specific proprietary implementations—it's applying well-established web development patterns to your specific needs.

This feels ethically different from AI-generated art that mimics specific artists' styles or AI-generated prose that replicates authors' voices. You're using AI as a tool to translate your intent into working code, not to replace or profit from others' creative work.

### Personal Ambivalence

You might feel conflicted about using AI at all. Many thoughtful people do. The technology raises genuine questions about what we're automating, what we're outsourcing, and what it means to make something.

This course acknowledges that tension. The philosophy here—building with care, making tools that serve rather than extract, taking responsibility for your digital infrastructure—runs counter to how AI is often deployed (at scale, for profit, optimizing for engagement).

If using AI feels wrong to you, that's valid. You can learn traditional web development instead. It takes longer but gives you deeper understanding.

But if you're ambivalent rather than opposed—if you see AI as a flawed tool that can still serve worthwhile ends—then building personal infrastructure seems like one of the more defensible uses.

### The Honest Answer

AI has real costs—environmental, labor, ethical. This course won't solve those problems. Using Claude for Field Guide doesn't make you a good person or a bad person. It's a choice with tradeoffs.

The question is: given that AI exists, given that you can use it, what's a thoughtful way to engage with it?

Field Guide offers one answer: use it to build small tools for your actual life, with attention and care, to reduce dependence on platforms that extract value from you. Use it to reclaim agency, not to scale or optimize or extract.

You can accept this reasoning or not. The course continues either way.

## Engineering as Understanding

Masahiro Mori treated engineering problems as spiritual questions. How does an automobile work? Not just mechanically—but what does its design reveal about interdependence? How do its parts rely on each other?

When you build with Claude, you do something similar. You understand how description becomes reality. How clarity of thought translates to working code. How iteration reveals what you actually want versus what you thought you wanted.

This is practical wisdom, not abstract philosophy. You learn by doing, then notice what the doing taught you.

Mori wrote: "The act of making something perfect is itself a form of meditation." He meant complete—doing one thing fully, with attention.

That's what these practices are. Each tool you build is a complete act. Whole. Made with care, used with attention, refined through use.

### Practice as Training

Buddhist practitioners don't meditate because they're already enlightened. They meditate to train the mind to return to the present moment when it wanders. The wandering is expected. The practice is in the returning.

Building is the same. You describe clearly when your thinking wanders into vagueness. You notice when ego arises ("this should be perfect"). You observe when attachment forms ("I must finish this today"). Then you return to the work.

Monks don't build without ego because they're perfect. They train in non-attachment through years of practice. You're doing the same thing with making tools: noticing when resistance arises, noticing when you grasp for results, noticing when you judge your work harshly.

The tools you build are real. And the practice of building them—with attention, without grasping—is also real. Both matter.

## What You're Actually Learning

**Clarity of thought.** Can you describe what you want specifically enough that someone (or something) else can build it? This is harder than it sounds. Most of us have vague ideas—"I want to save links better"—without being able to articulate what "better" means.

**Iterative refinement.** Nothing works perfectly the first time. You'll learn to make one change, see the result, then ask for the next thing. This is how all good work gets made.

**Taste.** You'll develop the ability to look at something and know what feels right and what feels off. This only comes from actually making things and paying attention to your reactions.

**Ownership.** When you build something yourself—even if Claude wrote the code—you understand it differently. You can modify it. You can fix it when it breaks. You control the vision of what the tool should be.

## What You're Not Learning

Software architecture. Design patterns. Git workflows. Deployment pipelines. Job preparation for developers.

Those things are useful for professional programmers. You need something more fundamental: how to turn an idea into a working thing. How to close the gap between "I wish this existed" and "here it is."

## The Shift

Most people using AI today consume products. They use ChatGPT for writing, Midjourney for images, Claude for conversations. Someone else built these products for them.

You're about to become a builder. You'll use Claude as a tool—something that helps you create things that never existed before.

This changes your relationship with technology. Instead of adapting yourself to fit the tools that exist, you make tools that fit how you think.

## Start Before You're Ready

The practices that follow will feel uncomfortable at first. You won't know the right words to describe what you want. Claude will build something that's close but not quite right. You'll feel like you're guessing.

That's normal. That's the process. You get better by doing it, not by studying first.

So start. Describe something. See what Claude builds. Ask for changes. Do it again. The capability develops through practice, not preparation.
