\newpage

Welcome to Field Guide. Over the next 13 weeks, I'll teach you to build your own AI-powered tools using Claude. You'll create personal infrastructure that does exactly what you need and nothing more.

This first post is free for everyone. It sets up why this matters and what's different about this moment.

---

In 1968, Stewart Brand published the first Whole Earth Catalog with a simple mission: give people access to tools. Tools readers could own, understand, and use to build the lives they wanted.

The catalog taught people how to find what they needed to become self-reliant. Geodesic dome plans. Cybernetics textbooks. Portable video recorders. Everything was chosen to help dispersed communities and builders create their own solutions instead of depending on institutions.

Brand believed that access to the right tools was revolutionary. If you could get your hands on the right information and equipment, you could build what you needed.

## The Same Problem, Different Tools

Today we face a similar moment. AI is everywhere, and everyone's supposed to have an opinion about it. Use it for work. Optimize your life with it. Let the big platforms decide what it does for you.

Most people using AI today rent someone else's vision of what AI should do. They use products. Products come with constraints: someone else's features, someone else's pricing, someone else's ideas about what matters.

## What You'll Actually Build

Field Guide teaches you to build your own AI-powered tools using Claude. You create personal infrastructure. Simple, useful utilities that do exactly what you need and nothing more.

A link catcher that saves what you care about without algorithmic recommendations. A daily log that respects your thoughts. A training tracker that works the way you think. A photo journal. A dashboard. Tools that fit how you actually work.

Simple projects. Single-file web pages. HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript. The kind of thing you can understand, modify, iterate on. The kind of thing you own.

## The Lineage

Field Guide stands in a specific tradition:

**Stewart Brand (1968)**: Access to tools for self-reliant living.

**Gary Snyder (1969)**: "The common work of the tribe." Building tools is fundamental human capability. You learn to build tools for the work that keeps you and your people alive and whole.

**Masahiro Mori (1974)**: Engineering as spiritual practice. Robots work with no ego, no agenda. When you build with AI, you direct a tool that has no preference for one solution over another. Claude just builds what you describe. The tool serves the task completely.

**Jean Boulton (2024)**: The world is organic, constantly in flow. Stability emerges from ongoing interaction. You describe → Claude generates → you test → you refine. The tool becomes useful because you responded to what emerged. This is fundamentally different from buying software or traditional coding that tries to predict everything upfront.

## What Changed: Creation Without Programming

Here's what's different from 1968: Claude can write the code. You describe what you want, you see what it builds, you ask it to change things. The loop is fast enough that building becomes a conversation.

This is genuinely new. New like the personal computer was new. A fundamental shift in who gets to create digital tools.

## Digital Self-Sufficiency

The Whole Earth Catalog gave people what they needed to build shelter, grow food, and create communities without depending on industrial systems. Field Guide gives you what you need to build your own digital tools without depending on Big Tech platforms.

You learn to describe what you want clearly. You learn to iterate—make one change, see the result, ask for the next thing. You learn to develop taste by paying attention to what feels right and what feels off.

By the end, you're building with AI. You have a set of working tools. More importantly, you have the capability to make more whenever you need them.

## The Course

Field Guide includes:

- 4 guides walking you through the fundamentals

- 9 hands-on practices, each building a different tool

- A prompt library with 50+ templates

- Troubleshooting for when things break

- Extensions for going further

You'll build: a personal page, link catcher, daily log, training tracker, record shelf, photo log, and dashboard. Each one teaches a different aspect of tool-building. Each one becomes something you actually use.

## Who This Is For

You feel pressure to engage with AI but reject the hustle culture that usually comes with it. You're drawn to maker philosophy and want to understand your tools. You value self-reliance over convenience. You'd rather build something imperfect that's yours than use something polished that belongs to someone else.

You just need to be willing to start before you're ready.

## Access to Tools

Stewart Brand ended the original Whole Earth Catalog in 1971 with a simple message on the back cover: "Stay hungry. Stay foolish."

The tools have changed. The principle remains.

# Week 2: Before You Begin

*This is Guide 01 of Field Guide—still free for everyone. If you missed last week's introduction, start there to understand what we're doing and why it matters.*

*This week is about mindset. About what you're actually learning to do, and what you're not.*

---

This is about capability, not credentials. When you have an idea—a tool that would make your life easier, a system that fits how you actually think, a thing that exists only in your mind—you can just make it.

You make it to have it. To use it. To own something you built with your own hands.

When you finish this guide, you'll just be someone who makes what they need.

## Escaping the Cage

Gary Snyder wrote: "Three-fourths of philosophy and literature is the talk of people trying to convince themselves that they really like the cage they were tricked into entering."

The cage, in tech, is: you must use what's built for you. Subscribe to services. Adapt to platforms. Let companies decide what features matter.

Most people accept this. They complain about software, but they don't imagine alternatives. They assume building is for professionals.

Field Guide teaches you to step out of that cage. Not because you're special—because it's actually possible now. Claude removes the technical barrier that kept building walled off.

The cage exists in your mind. You believe you can't make what you need.

Snyder spent decades living in the mountains, building his own house, growing food, writing poetry. Self-reliance through skill and attention. He chose which parts of civilization to engage with on his own terms.

You can do the same with technology. Build what serves you. Ignore what doesn't. Choose your tools deliberately instead of accepting what's marketed to you.

## What This Actually Means

Programming is a skill—syntax, patterns, best practices, computer science fundamentals. It takes years to get good at it.

Building is a practice. You describe something, you see it exist, you refine it until it works. The loop is fast. The barrier is low. You develop taste and clarity about what you want.

Claude writes the code. You direct it. You test what it makes. You ask for changes. You develop judgment about what works and what doesn't.

This is new. Five years ago, if you wanted a custom tool, you had two options: learn to code (months or years of effort) or hire someone (expensive, slow, you lose control). Now there's a third way: describe it clearly enough that Claude can build it.

## On Using AI Thoughtfully

Before going further, let's address the concerns you might have about using AI.

### The Environmental Cost

Training large language models requires significant energy. This is real. Data centers consume resources. The environmental impact matters.

Context: The AI models already exist. Using Claude to build nine personal tools over 13 weeks uses a tiny fraction of the energy that went into training the model—comparable to a few dozen Google searches. Billions of people use AI for casual queries daily. Your focused use to build tools that reduce your dependence on extractive platforms is directionally better.

This doesn't make the environmental cost disappear. But if AI exists and you can't personally stop it, using it to reclaim agency over your digital life seems like one of the more thoughtful applications.

### Labor and Displacement

AI tools are built on human labor—both the engineers who create them and the human work that trains them. Concerns about job displacement in creative and technical fields are legitimate.

This course teaches you to build personal tools for yourself, not to replace human workers or launch products that compete with people's livelihoods. The intent matters.

There's a difference between:
- Using AI to build nine small tools for your actual life
- Using AI to generate content at scale for profit
- Using AI to replace human craftspeople

Field Guide sits in the first category. You're building for yourself. No extraction. No scale. No replacement of human work.

### Copyright and Training Data

AI models are trained on vast amounts of text, code, and creative work—much of it copyrighted. The ethics of this are contested and evolving through courts and policy.

What you're building: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following documented standards and common patterns. The code Claude generates for personal tools isn't copying specific proprietary implementations—it's applying well-established web development patterns to your specific needs.

This feels ethically different from AI-generated art that mimics specific artists' styles or AI-generated prose that replicates authors' voices. You're using AI as a tool to translate your intent into working code, not to replace or profit from others' creative work.

### Personal Ambivalence

You might feel conflicted about using AI at all. Many thoughtful people do. The technology raises genuine questions about what we're automating, what we're outsourcing, and what it means to make something.

This course acknowledges that tension. The philosophy here—building with care, making tools that serve rather than extract, taking responsibility for your digital infrastructure—runs counter to how AI is often deployed (at scale, for profit, optimizing for engagement).

If using AI feels wrong to you, that's valid. You can learn traditional web development instead. It takes longer but gives you deeper understanding.

But if you're ambivalent rather than opposed—if you see AI as a flawed tool that can still serve worthwhile ends—then building personal infrastructure seems like one of the more defensible uses.

### The Honest Answer

AI has real costs—environmental, labor, ethical. This course won't solve those problems. Using Claude for Field Guide doesn't make you a good person or a bad person. It's a choice with tradeoffs.

The question is: given that AI exists, given that you can use it, what's a thoughtful way to engage with it?

Field Guide offers one answer: use it to build small tools for your actual life, with attention and care, to reduce dependence on platforms that extract value from you. Use it to reclaim agency, not to scale or optimize or extract.

You can accept this reasoning or not. The course continues either way.

---

## Engineering as Understanding

Masahiro Mori treated engineering problems as spiritual questions. How does an automobile work? Not just mechanically—but what does its design reveal about interdependence? How do its parts rely on each other?

When you build with Claude, you do something similar. You understand how description becomes reality. How clarity of thought translates to working code. How iteration reveals what you actually want versus what you thought you wanted.

This is practical wisdom, not abstract philosophy. You learn by doing, then notice what the doing taught you.

Mori wrote: "The act of making something perfect is itself a form of meditation." He meant complete—doing one thing fully, with attention.

That's what these practices are. Each tool you build is a complete act. Whole. Made with care, used with attention, refined through use.

### Practice as Training

Buddhist practitioners don't meditate because they're already enlightened. They meditate to train the mind to return to the present moment when it wanders. The wandering is expected. The practice is in the returning.

Building is the same. You describe clearly when your thinking wanders into vagueness. You notice when ego arises ("this should be perfect"). You observe when attachment forms ("I must finish this today"). Then you return to the work.

Monks don't build without ego because they're perfect. They train in non-attachment through years of practice. You're doing the same thing with making tools: noticing when resistance arises, noticing when you grasp for results, noticing when you judge your work harshly.

The tools you build are real. And the practice of building them—with attention, without grasping—is also real. Both matter.

## What You're Actually Learning

**Clarity of thought.** Can you describe what you want specifically enough that someone (or something) else can build it? This is harder than it sounds. Most of us have vague ideas—"I want to save links better"—without being able to articulate what "better" means.

**Iterative refinement.** Nothing works perfectly the first time. You'll learn to make one change, see the result, then ask for the next thing. This is how all good work gets made.

**Taste.** You'll develop the ability to look at something and know what feels right and what feels off. This only comes from actually making things and paying attention to your reactions.

**Ownership.** When you build something yourself—even if Claude wrote the code—you understand it differently. You can modify it. You can fix it when it breaks. You control the vision of what the tool should be.

## What You're Not Learning

Software architecture. Design patterns. Git workflows. Deployment pipelines. Job preparation for developers.

Those things are useful for professional programmers. You need something more fundamental: how to turn an idea into a working thing. How to close the gap between "I wish this existed" and "here it is."

## The Shift

Most people using AI today consume products. They use ChatGPT for writing, Midjourney for images, Claude for conversations. Someone else built these products for them.

You're about to become a builder. You'll use Claude as a tool—something that helps you create things that never existed before.

This changes your relationship with technology. Instead of adapting yourself to fit the tools that exist, you make tools that fit how you think.

## Start Before You're Ready

The practices that follow will feel uncomfortable at first. You won't know the right words to describe what you want. Claude will build something that's close but not quite right. You'll feel like you're guessing.

That's normal. That's the process. You get better by doing it, not by studying first.

So start. Describe something. See what Claude builds. Ask for changes. Do it again. The capability develops through practice, not preparation.

**Next week:** Guide 02 - Setting Up + Practice 01: Starting. We'll get your tools ready (Claude, a text editor, and a terminal) and build your first thing—a personal page. One HTML file. Something real.

**This is the last free guide.** After next week's setup guide and first practice, the remaining content requires a paid subscription. 

If you know you want to follow the full course, subscribe now at the founding member rate—it won't be this cheap again.


\newpage



# Week 3: Setting Up + Your First Build

*This is the last free post. After today, you'll need a paid subscription to continue with the practices.*

*This week: get your tools ready and build your first thing—a personal page. One HTML file. No complexity. Just something real.*

---

## Part 1: Setting Up

You need three things: a computer, a Claude subscription, and a text editor.

**Claude:** Sign up at claude.ai. The Pro plan ($20/month) gives you the access you need. This is your collaborator—the one who writes the code while you direct.

**Text Editor:** VS Code is free and works great. Download it from code.visualstudio.com. This is where you'll see and manage the code Claude writes.

**Terminal:** Your computer already has one. On Mac, it's called Terminal. On Windows, use PowerShell. This is how you run what you build.

That's it. No frameworks to learn. No languages to memorize. Just these three tools and you're ready.

### Getting Everything Running

1. **Install VS Code** - Download, install, open it. Create a new folder somewhere you'll remember (like Documents/field-guide).

2. **Open the folder in VS Code** - File → Open Folder. This is your workspace.

3. **Find your terminal** - On Mac, search for "Terminal" in Spotlight. On Windows, search for "PowerShell". We'll use this later to run things.

4. **Sign up for Claude Pro** - Go to claude.ai, create an account, upgrade to Pro. You'll use this to generate code.

Don't worry about understanding everything yet. Just get the tools installed. You'll learn what they do by using them.

---

## Part 2: Practice 01 - Starting

**Build:** Personal Page  
**Principle:** Start before you're ready

### The Sacredness of Ordinary Work

Gary Snyder: "Such a round of chores is not a set of difficulties we hope to escape from... it is our path."

He's talking about cutting wood, carrying water, tending gardens. The daily work that keeps a household running. Essential.

Building personal tools is the same kind of work.

You're creating infrastructure for your actual life: a way to save links, track workouts, remember what you notice.

This is humble work. That's the point.

The first tool you build (a personal page) is almost embarrassingly simple. One HTML file. Your name, a bio, some links.

But it's yours. You made it. It exists because you described it and Claude helped you bring it into being.

Snyder would recognize this as real work: taking responsibility for your own needs, one small tool at a time.

### What You'll Build

A single-page personal website with your name, a short bio, and links to your email and social profiles. One file. No hosting yet. Just something real.

This is your first build. No frameworks, no complexity. The goal: see that you can describe something and have it exist. That's the magic we're after.

Start.

### Step 01: Open Claude and describe yourself

Start a conversation with Claude and describe what you want.

**Prompt to copy:**

```
I want to create a simple personal webpage. Just one HTML file with:
- My name as the main heading
- A short bio (2-3 sentences about who I am)
- Links to my email and social profiles
- Clean, minimal design
- Should work as a single file I can open in my browser

My info:
Name: [Your Name]
Bio: [Your 2-3 sentence bio]
Email: [your@email.com]
Social links: [Twitter/LinkedIn/GitHub/etc URLs]

Please create the complete HTML file for this.
```

Claude will give you the full HTML. Copy all of it.

### Step 02: Save the file

1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new file (File → New File)
3. Paste the HTML Claude gave you
4. Save it as `index.html` in your field-guide folder

### Step 03: Open it in your browser

Find the file in your file explorer (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows). Double-click it. It should open in your default browser.

You'll see your page. Your name. Your bio. Your links.

**This is yours. You made it.**

### Step 04: Make a change

Go back to Claude and ask for something different:

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Can you update the page to:
- Add a profile photo at the top
- Change the font to something more interesting
- Add a subtle background color
```

Claude will give you updated HTML. Copy it, paste it into VS Code (replacing the old code), save, refresh your browser.

See the changes? That's the loop. Describe → Generate → Test → Refine.

### Step 05: Keep going

Ask Claude for more changes:
- Different colors
- Add a section for projects or interests
- Change the layout
- Add links to things you've made

The point isn't to make it perfect. The point is to see that you can shape it. You describe, Claude builds, you test, you ask for changes.

This is how all the tools you'll build work. Same process, different content.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** The page looks broken or incomplete
**Likely cause:** You didn't copy all of Claude's code from the response
**Solution:** Make sure you copied everything from `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the start to `</html>` at the end. If you missed any part, go back and copy the complete code block.

**Problem:** Claude gives an error message
**Likely cause:** The prompt was unclear or there's a syntax issue in the code
**Solution:** Read the error message—it often tells you what's wrong. Copy the full error back to Claude and ask: "I got this error: [paste error]. Can you fix it?"

**Problem:** I don't know what to ask for next
**Likely cause:** You're overthinking it—start small
**Solution:** Ask for simple changes first: "make the text bigger" or "use a different color" or "add my photo". You'll get better at describing what you want as you practice.

**Problem:** The page looks ugly or unprofessional
**Likely cause:** This is your first build—aesthetics come later
**Solution:** That's fine for now. You're learning the process, not design. Focus on getting the loop working. We'll cover making things look better in later practices.

**Problem:** The HTML file won't open in my browser
**Likely cause:** File extension is wrong or file wasn't saved properly
**Solution:** Make sure the file ends with `.html` (not `.txt` or `.html.txt`). Try right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" then choosing your browser.

**Problem:** Changes I asked for didn't appear
**Likely cause:** You didn't save the updated code or you're viewing the old file
**Solution:** Make sure you replaced all the code in your HTML file with Claude's new version. Save the file, then refresh your browser with Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows).

## Reflection

Before moving on, notice what just happened:

**You described something.** You told Claude what you wanted in plain language.

**It existed.** Claude wrote code that made your description real.

**You could change it.** You asked for modifications and got them.

**You own it.** The file is on your computer. You can modify it, delete it, share it. It's yours.

This is the fundamental capability you're building. Everything else in Field Guide is variations on this: describe clearly, iterate until it works, own what you make.

## Going Further

If you want to keep experimenting:
- Add more sections (favorite books, current projects, ways to contact you)
- Try different visual styles (minimal, colorful, dark mode)
- Add links to work you've done
- Include a profile photo or background image
- Experiment with layouts (centered, sidebar, grid)

The point is to get comfortable with the loop. Describe something. See it work. Ask for changes. Repeat.

# Week 4: The Loop

*This is the first paid-subscriber-only post. If you're seeing this, you've committed to building alongside me for the next 10 weeks. Thank you.*

*Last week you built your first thing—a personal page. This week we're going to formalize the method you used so you can apply it to everything else.*

## Making Sense Through Making

Complexity scientist Jean Boulton writes about "making sense" versus jumping to quick solutions. Understanding patterns and processes is more important than having immediate answers.

The loop is a sense-making practice:

**Describe** → You articulate what you want clearly enough that someone (or something) else can build it. Vague ideas become explicit. You make sense of what you actually need.

**Generate** → Claude builds. You see your idea externalized.

**Test** → Reality talks back. The tool reveals what you missed in your description.

**Refine** → You adjust based on what emerged, not what you predicted.

Each cycle makes more sense. Not because you're getting smarter—because you're engaging with feedback from reality.

Traditional education teaches you to plan thoroughly before acting. This teaches you to act in order to learn. Small iterations, continuous adjustment, emergent understanding.

Boulton structures her book as 73 short, networked pieces—you can open it anywhere and find something useful. The practices in Field Guide work the same way. Each one is complete on its own, but they connect. You can build them in any order. The understanding emerges from doing them, not from reading about them.

## The Middle Way in Building

Buddhist philosophy talks about the Middle Way—avoiding extremes. Not too tight, not too loose. Not overthinking, not rushing.

The loop embodies this:
- You describe (but not in exhaustive detail)
- Claude generates (but you don't blindly accept)
- You test (but you don't obsess)
- You refine (but you don't endlessly iterate)

The loop operates in the middle—enough direction to proceed, enough openness to discover.

Masahiro Mori believed robots could teach humans about Buddhist practice because they act without attachment to outcomes. They respond to clear direction without clinging to their first attempt or taking feedback personally.

Claude works the same way. You describe what you want, it adjusts. No defense of code. No ego invested in any particular solution. No resistance.

This makes iteration faster because Claude has no self to protect.

## Reflexive Interaction

Boulton describes stability emerging from "reflexive interactions among diverse elements."

In traditional software development, you interact with requirements documents, architecture diagrams, test specs. All representations, all predictions.

In Field Guide, you interact with:
- **Your actual use** (not imagined use cases)
- **Real friction points** (not anticipated edge cases)  
- **What you notice** (not what metrics tell you)
- **The tool's behavior** (not the code itself)

This is reflexive—the tool shapes your understanding, you reshape the tool, repeat. Neither you nor the tool is fixed. Both adapt.

Claude accelerates this because it has no attachment to its previous solutions. It rebuilds without ego. You can try five different approaches in an hour, each one informing the next.

Complex systems work this way. Through rapid cycles of interaction and adjustment, not through master plans.

## The Loop: Describe → Generate → Test → Refine

Everything you build follows this pattern. It's your methodology. You'll use it for simple pages and complex tools. The more you practice, the better you get at describing what you want.

### Describe

Tell Claude what you want. Be specific about **what** it should do, not **how** it should work.

**Good description:**
> "I want a page that saves URLs with notes and lets me search them later."

**Bad description:**
> "Build me a React app with localStorage and a search component using state management."

See the difference? The first describes the outcome. The second prescribes the implementation. Claude knows how to build things. You describe what you want the thing to do.

#### Getting Specific

If your first description is vague, Claude will make assumptions. Sometimes those assumptions are right. Often they're close but not quite what you wanted.

Add specifics:
- "Show the most recent links first"
- "Let me filter by tags"
- "Make the search work in real-time as I type"
- "Store everything locally so it works offline"

The more specific you are upfront, the less back-and-forth you'll need.

#### What to Describe

Focus on:
- **What it does:** "Saves links with titles and notes"
- **How you interact with it:** "A form at the top, list of saved links below"
- **What happens when:** "When I click save, add it to the list immediately"
- **What it should look like:** "Keep it minimal, use warm colors"

Leave to Claude:
- **Technical implementation:** Claude picks the right approach
- **Code structure:** Claude handles this
- **Best practices:** Claude knows these

#### Technical Note: localStorage

Most tools in this course use **localStorage**—a way to save data in your browser. Quick things to know:

- **Storage limit:** 5-10MB (roughly 5,000-10,000 text entries, or 50-100 images)
- **Browser-specific:** Data saved in Chrome stays in Chrome, doesn't sync to Firefox or Safari
- **Persistent:** Data stays until you clear browser data or explicitly delete it
- **Local only:** Nothing goes to a server, everything stays on your computer
- **Privacy:** Anyone with access to your computer can read localStorage using browser dev tools

This works great for personal tools. If you hit storage limits or need data to sync across devices, you'll explore other options later.

For now: localStorage is perfect for building and learning. It's simple, fast, and requires no setup.

### Generate

Claude writes the code. Copy it into your text editor. Save the file.

**One file or multiple?** For the tools in this course, we're sticking with single files. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all in one place. This keeps things simple and portable.

**Understanding the code:** You need to understand what it does, not every line. If you're curious about how something works, ask Claude: "Explain what this part does and why you wrote it this way."

**Copying cleanly:** 
1. Claude will give you code in a code block
2. Click the copy button (or select all and copy)
3. Paste into VS Code
4. Save with the right file extension (.html for web pages)

### Test

Run it. Open it in your browser. Click around. Does it do what you wanted?

**How to test:**
1. Open the HTML file in your browser (double-click it)
2. Try every feature you asked for
3. Try breaking it—type weird things, click rapidly, leave fields empty
4. Notice what works and what doesn't

**What you're looking for:**
- Does it do what you described?
- Is anything confusing or unclear?
- What feels good? What feels off?
- What's missing?

Look for what to fix next.

### Refine

Go back to Claude and describe what needs to change.

**Be specific about the problem:**

Bad: "The search doesn't work"  
Good: "When I search for 'design', it doesn't find links that have 'Design' with a capital D"

Bad: "Make it look better"  
Good: "The text is too small to read comfortably. Make the font size 18px instead of 14px"

**Ask for one change at a time** when you're learning. Later you can batch multiple changes, but starting out, make one adjustment, test it, then move to the next.

## When to Stop

You could refine forever. There's always something to improve. But remember: these are personal tools, not products.

**Stop when:**
- It does what you need it to do
- You'd rather use it than keep tweaking it
- The friction is low enough that you don't notice it
- Adding more would make it more complex without making it more useful

Gary Snyder's concept of "real work" applies here: the tool needs to serve its purpose. A well-made thing is complete, not flawless.

## Common Patterns

After you've done the loop a few times, you'll notice patterns:

**First try is 70% right.** Claude usually gets the main functionality working but misses details or makes assumptions you wanted differently.

**Second iteration gets you to 90%.** You clarify what needs to change. Claude adjusts. Most problems disappear.

**Final 10% is polish.** Colors, spacing, small interaction improvements. This is where taste develops.

**Knowing when you're done.** When it's useful enough that you'd rather use it than continue building.

## Practice: Build a Quick Tool

To solidify the loop, build something small right now.

**The challenge:** Make a tool that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

**Describe to Claude:**
```
I want a simple temperature converter.
- Two input boxes: one for Fahrenheit, one for Celsius
- When I type in either box, automatically convert to the other
- Show the formula being used
- Keep it minimal and clean
```

**Generate:** Copy Claude's code, save as `converter.html`

**Test:** Open it, try converting 32°F (should show 0°C), try 100°C (should show 212°F)

**Refine:** Ask Claude to improve something—maybe add Kelvin, or change colors, or add clear buttons

**Notice:** How many iterations did it take to feel done? What did you learn about describing clearly?

## Next Week

Practice 02: Capture. You'll build a link catcher—a tool that saves URLs with notes and lets you search them. It's the first genuinely useful tool in the course.

We'll use everything you learned this week: describe clearly, iterate fast, stop when it's useful.

## Reflection: On Friction and Dukkha

The First Noble Truth in Buddhism is dukkha—often translated as "suffering" but more accurately "unsatisfactoriness" or "friction." The fundamental sense that things aren't quite right.

When you use a tool that doesn't work how you think, that's dukkha. The app that's almost good enough but not quite. The feature that should exist but doesn't. The interface that fights your mental model.

You can't build a tool that eliminates all friction forever. The Second Noble Truth says dissatisfaction is inherent in conditioned existence. Tools break. Needs change. Perfect is impossible.

But you can build tools that reduce unnecessary friction. That work how you think. That respect your attention. The loop—describe, generate, test, refine—is how you respond skillfully to the friction that teaches you something.

The constant dissatisfaction with existing tools, the feeling that "this app doesn't work right"—that's not a problem to solve once and for all. It's information. Your dissatisfaction is telling you something about how you think and what you need.

The practice is understanding friction clearly enough to respond to it, not eliminating all discomfort from existence.

---

**Reflection question:** What's harder—describing what you want, or accepting that the first version won't be perfect? Both are skills. Both improve with practice.

# Week 5: Practice 02 - Capture (Link Catcher)

*You've built your first tool and learned the loop. This week we're building something more complex: a link catcher that actually saves, searches, and organizes your bookmarks.*

---

**Build:** Link Catcher
**Principle:** Don't let things slip away

## Why Build This?

You have 47 browser tabs open right now. Maybe more. Each one represents something you thought was worth keeping: an article to read later, a tool to explore, a reference you might need.

Browser bookmarks exist. But bookmarks become graveyards. You bookmark things and never look at them again. They sync everywhere you don't want them. The folders get messy. There's no way to add context about why you saved something or what you were thinking at the time.

Link management apps exist too. Pocket, Raindrop, Instapaper. They're polished and feature-rich. They also want your data, show you algorithmic recommendations, require accounts, cost money, and might disappear when the company pivots or shuts down.

This tool forces intention. When you save a link, you add a note about why it matters. You tag it with your own taxonomy. You search with your own words. The tool works exactly how you think, because you built it for yourself.

Also: you own the data. It's in localStorage on your computer. Export it whenever you want. The tool costs nothing, requires no account, tracks nothing, and will keep working as long as you have the HTML file.

## What You'll Build

A simple web app where you can:
- Paste a URL and give it a title
- Add notes and tags
- See all your saved links in a list
- Filter by tag or search
- Delete links you no longer need

Everything stored locally on your computer. No sync, no cloud, no tracking.

---

## Step 01: Start with the basics

Ask Claude for a simple link-saving app. Don't ask for tags or search yet—start with the core.

**Prompt:**
```
Build me a single-page web app for saving links. I want to paste a URL, add a title and optional notes, then see all my saved links in a list below the form. Use HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Store links in localStorage so they persist.
```

**Tip:** Start simple. Add more later. Focus the first version on doing one thing well.

Save the code as `link-catcher.html` and open it in your browser.

---

## Step 02: Test and observe

Add 3-4 real links you've been meaning to save. Notice what's missing. What's annoying? What do you wish it did? Write these down.

This is the most important step. You need to actually use the thing before you know what it needs.

---

## Step 03: Add tags

Tags let you categorize without folders. Ask Claude to add tagging.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a tags field to the link form. Let me type comma-separated tags when saving a link. Show tags as small pills under each link in the list. When I click a tag, filter the list to show only links with that tag.
```

**Tip:** If the tags look ugly, tell Claude what you want them to look like. "Make the tags smaller" or "use a subtle background color" works.

---

## Step 04: Add search

When you have more than a dozen links, you'll want search.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a search box above the link list. As I type, filter the links to show only those where the title, notes, or tags contain my search text. Make it filter in real-time as I type.
```

Test it. Search for something. Does it find what you expect?

---

## Step 05: Add timestamps and delete

Know when you saved something. Remove what you don't need.

**Prompt:**
```
Show the date each link was saved, formatted like "Jan 15, 2024". Add a delete button for each link. When I click delete, show a confirmation before removing it.
```

**Tip:** If the date format isn't what you want, just tell Claude: "Format dates like '2 days ago' instead" or "Just show the month and day".

---

## Step 06: Make it yours

Change the colors. Adjust the spacing. Add your own fields. This is yours now.

Maybe you want a "priority" field. Maybe you want to group links by project. Maybe you want the most recent links at the top.

Ask for what you want. See what Claude builds. Refine until it feels right.

---

## Additional Prompts

**Export your data:**
```
Add an "Export" button that downloads all my saved links as a JSON file. Name the file "links-backup-[date].json".
```
*Use when you want to back up your links or move them to another computer.*

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
```
Add keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+V (or Ctrl+V on Windows) should focus the URL field. Escape should clear any active filters and search. Cmd+K should focus the search box.
```
*Use when you're a keyboard person and want faster interaction.*

**Sortable list:**
```
Let me sort the link list by date saved (newest or oldest first) or alphabetically by title. Add small buttons or a dropdown to switch between sort orders.
```
*Use when you want to find your oldest saves or browse alphabetically.*

**Bookmarklet:**
```
Create a bookmarklet I can drag to my browser bookmarks bar. When I click it on any page, it should open my Link Catcher with the current page's URL and title pre-filled.
```
*Use when you want to save links without manually copying URLs.*

**Import from browser:**
```
Add an "Import" button that accepts a browser bookmarks HTML file and imports all the links with their titles.
```
*Use when you want to migrate your existing bookmarks.*

---

## When Things Break

**Problem:** All saved links disappear after closing the browser
**Likely cause:** localStorage isn't working in your browser or you're in private/incognito mode
**Solution:** Check the browser console (press F12) for errors. Some browsers disable localStorage for local files or in private mode. Try opening the file normally (not private mode) or ask Claude: "Check if localStorage is working correctly. Add console logs to show when data is saved and loaded."

**Problem:** The delete button removes the wrong link
**Likely cause:** Each link doesn't have a unique ID being passed to the delete function
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make sure each delete button knows which specific link to delete. Each link needs a unique ID that gets passed to the delete function."

**Problem:** Tags don't filter the links properly
**Likely cause:** Case sensitivity or extra whitespace in tag comparison
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Show me the filter logic for tags. Make it case-insensitive and trim whitespace so 'design' matches 'Design' and ' design '."

**Problem:** Styling looks wrong or elements are misaligned
**Likely cause:** CSS isn't loading properly or there's a layout conflict
**Solution:** Take a screenshot and share it with Claude. Say: "This doesn't look right. The [specific element] should be [what you want]. Here's what it looks like now: [attach screenshot]."

**Problem:** Search is slow when I have many links
**Likely cause:** Search filters on every keystroke without delay
**Solution:** You probably don't have enough links for this to matter yet. But if it's slow, ask Claude: "Debounce the search so it only filters 300ms after I stop typing."

**Problem:** Can't add links with certain special characters in the URL
**Likely cause:** URL isn't being encoded or validated properly
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Validate and properly encode URLs before saving them. Handle special characters and ensure the URL format is correct."

**Problem:** Links open in the same tab instead of a new tab
**Likely cause:** Links don't have the target="_blank" attribute
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make all saved links open in a new tab when clicked."

---

## Reflection

After you've used your link catcher for a few days, consider:
- What did you actually end up saving? Does it match what you thought you'd save?
- Did you add any fields or features Claude didn't suggest?
- How is this different from your browser bookmarks? Better? Worse? Just different?
- What would make you actually use this instead of leaving tabs open?

---

## Going Further

Ideas if you want to keep building:
- Sync across devices (requires a backend—this is a bigger project)
- Auto-fetch page titles and descriptions from URLs
- Generate a weekly digest email of your saved links
- Add "read later" status and mark links as read
- Group links by project or topic with drag-and-drop
- Add favicons for each link automatically

---

**Next week:** Practice 03 - Remember (Daily Log). A simple journal where you write an entry each day and browse back through past entries. No prompts. No streaks. Just a place to dump thoughts.

See you then.


\newpage



# Week 6: Remember (Practice 03: Daily Log)

*Week 6 of Field Guide. You've built a personal page and a link catcher. This week: a daily log. Not for productivity tracking—for remembering what you noticed.*

---

## Daily Practice

Gary Snyder kept journals throughout his life—recording observations, thoughts, work done. Not for publication (though they eventually were). For practice.

The daily log you're building serves the same purpose. Not to perform productivity. Not to track metrics. To create a record of what you noticed, what you thought, what happened.

Snyder: "The real work is to make the world as real as it is, and to find ourselves as real as we are within it."

Writing daily makes you real to yourself. You see patterns you might otherwise miss. You remember what matters. You practice attention.

The tool makes writing easier. Remove friction, increase practice. Simple as that.

---

## Practice 03: Remember

**Build:** Daily Log
**Principle:** Writing as attention practice

### Why Build This?

You might already use Day One, Notion, Bear, or any of the dozens of journaling apps. They're polished. They have beautiful typography. They sync across devices. They offer prompts, templates, mood tracking, and habit streaks.

They also gamify your thoughts. Streak counters create guilt when you skip a day. Prompts channel your thinking into predefined patterns. Feature bloat makes the interface busy. Subscription models mean your journal might disappear if you stop paying.

This tool respects the practice. No prompts telling you what to write. No streaks making you feel bad about natural rhythms. No features you didn't ask for. No subscription that might end.

Just a text box, a timestamp, and your thoughts. Stored locally. Always available. Completely private.

The simplicity removes friction. When there's nothing between you and the blank page—no UI to navigate, no features to consider—you're more likely to actually write. The tool disappears. The practice remains.

### What You'll Build

A simple journal where you write daily entries. Text and timestamps. No prompts. No streaks. No gamification. Just a place to dump thoughts.

Features:
- Write an entry with today's date auto-filled
- See all your past entries (most recent first)
- Search through entries
- Optional: calendar view showing which days you wrote
- Storage: localStorage (all data stays on your device)

### Why This Tool

Most journaling apps are loaded with features you never asked for: prompts, mood tracking, streaks, sharing, premium tiers. They try to turn journaling into something you optimize.

This tool lets you write and see what you've written.

The practice lives in showing up to write. The tool gets out of the way.

### Step 01: Describe what you want

**Prompt to copy:**

```
I want to build a daily journal as a single HTML file.

Features:
- Text area at the top to write an entry
- Button to save the entry with today's date
- Display all saved entries below, most recent first
- Each entry shows: date, text, and a delete button
- Add a search box that filters entries in real-time
- Store everything in localStorage
- Keep the design clean and minimal

Make it work as a standalone file I can open in my browser.
```

### Step 02: Test the basics

Claude will generate the code. Save it as `journal.html` and open it.

Try:
- Writing an entry and saving it
- Writing another entry
- Refreshing the page (your entries should persist)
- Searching for a word in your entries
- Deleting an entry

Does it work? Good. Now refine.

### Step 03: Add date navigation

Go back to Claude:

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Add a calendar view that:
- Shows the current month
- Highlights days where I wrote entries
- When I click a highlighted day, show only that day's entries
- Add "Previous Month" and "Next Month" buttons
```

Test this. Can you navigate to past months? Can you see which days you wrote?

### Step 04: Improve the writing experience

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Make these improvements to the text area:
- Auto-focus the text area when the page loads
- Add character count below the text area
- Make the text area bigger (taller)
- Add a keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows) to save
```

Test: Open the page. Is your cursor already in the text area? Can you save with the keyboard shortcut?

### Step 05: Polish the visual design

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Update the design:
- Use a warm, paper-like background color (#FFF8F0)
- Make the text area look like a notepad with subtle lines
- Use a serif font for entries (like Georgia or Merriweather)
- Add subtle shadows to make entries feel like cards
- Increase spacing between elements
```

This is where the tool starts to feel like yours. Adjust colors, fonts, spacing until it feels right.

### Extensions (Optional)

If you want to keep building:

**Entry metadata:**
```
Add timestamps (not just dates) to each entry.
Show "Written at 3:24 PM" below each entry.
```

**Export functionality:**
```
Add a button to export all entries as a .txt file.
Each entry should be formatted as:
Date - Time
Entry text
---
```

**Word count stats:**
```
Add a stats section showing:
- Total entries
- Total words written
- Longest entry
- Writing streak (consecutive days)
```

**Tags:**
```
Let me add optional tags to entries.
Show all tags used across all entries.
Let me filter entries by tag.
```

**Entry editing:**
```
Add an "Edit" button to each entry.
When clicked, load the entry text into the text area.
Replace "Save Entry" with "Update Entry" when editing.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** All journal entries disappear when I refresh the page
**Likely cause:** localStorage is blocked or not working in your browser
**Solution:** Check the browser console (press F12) for errors. Make sure you're opening the file with the `file://` protocol. Some browsers block localStorage for local files—if this is the issue, ask Claude: "Set up a simple local server so localStorage works properly."

**Problem:** Calendar doesn't highlight days that have entries
**Likely cause:** Date format mismatch between saved entries and calendar display
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Debug why the calendar isn't highlighting days with entries. Make sure the date format matches between saving and displaying."

**Problem:** Can't find entries when searching
**Likely cause:** Search is case-sensitive or only searches titles (not content)
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make the search case-insensitive and search both titles and entry content so I can find 'writing' when I search for 'Writing'."

**Problem:** Text area is too small on mobile devices
**Likely cause:** Fixed sizing doesn't adapt to screen size
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make the text area responsive—bigger on desktop, still usable on mobile. It should resize based on screen width."

**Problem:** Lost all my entries and can't recover them
**Likely cause:** localStorage was cleared or the browser cache was deleted
**Solution:** There's no built-in backup. Ask Claude to add: "Add an export button that saves all entries to a JSON file. Also add an import button to restore from backup."

**Problem:** Want to write entries for past dates
**Likely cause:** Date picker defaults to today
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Let me select any date when creating an entry, not just today. Add a date picker to the entry form."

**Problem:** Entries are saved but show up in wrong order
**Likely cause:** Sorting logic isn't working correctly
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Sort entries by date in reverse chronological order (newest first). Make sure the date comparison works properly."

## Reflection

Gary Snyder wrote about "the common work of the tribe"—the daily tasks that keep you whole. Writing is about noticing, not performance.

This tool makes writing easier. The practice is still yours.

Some questions:
- Will you actually use this daily?
- What makes the difference between a tool you use and a tool you abandon?
- Is there something missing that would make you write more often?

The best tools disappear. You stop thinking about the tool and just do the thing. If this journal feels invisible—if you just write without thinking about the interface—it's working.

## Next Week

Practice 04: Move. You'll build a training log for tracking workouts. Sets, reps, progress over time. Same loop, different domain.

---

**Note:** If you're not a journaler, don't force it. Build this as practice with the loop, then move on. Not every tool you build needs to become a daily habit. Some are just learning exercises.


\newpage



# Week 7: Practice 04 - Move (Training Log)

*This week: a workout tracker. No calorie counting, no social features, no badges. Just log what you did, note how it felt, see your history.*

---

**Build:** Training Log
**Principle:** The body keeps the score

## Why Build This?

Strong, Hevy, FitNotes, JEFIT—there are dozens of workout tracking apps. They're feature-rich: exercise libraries with animations, progress charts, social features, workout plans, rest timers, one-rep-max calculators.

They also track everything you do and use it for their business model. They show you ads. They push you toward premium subscriptions. They gamify your training with badges and streaks. They suggest workouts based on what other users do, not what your body needs.

Most importantly: they track things you don't care about. Total volume. Calories burned (wildly inaccurate). Body fat percentage (even more wildly inaccurate). Social comparisons. Achievement unlocked animations.

This tool tracks what actually matters to you. If you only care about weight and reps, track that. If you want to note "felt strong today" or "left shoulder tweaky," add that. If you want to see your squat progression over six months, build that view.

The tool serves your training, not someone else's idea of what training should look like. Your data stays on your device. No account required. No subscription. No ads. No social pressure.

## What You'll Build

A workout tracker where you:
- Log exercises with sets, reps, and weight
- Add notes about how you felt
- See your history for each exercise
- Track progress over time

No calorie counting. No social features. No streaks.

---

## Step 01: Build the basic logger

Start with logging exercises, sets, reps, and weight.

**Prompt:**
```
Build me a workout tracker. I want to log exercises with: exercise name, sets, reps, weight, and a notes field. Save each workout with the date. Show a list of recent workouts. Use localStorage.
```

**Tip:** Start with your actual workout. What do you actually track?

Save as `training-log.html` and open it.

---

## Step 02: Log a real workout

Enter your last workout. Notice what fields you use and what you skip. Notice what's missing.

Did you write "bench press" or "Bench Press" or "BP"? How did you handle multiple sets? Did you want to note how you felt?

These observations tell you what to ask for next.

---

## Step 03: Add exercise templates

Save exercises you do often.

**Prompt:**
```
Let me save exercise templates (like "Bench Press" or "Squat") so I don't have to type them each time. Show a dropdown of my saved exercises.
```

**Tip:** Only add templates for exercises you actually do. Don't try to build a comprehensive exercise database.

---

## Step 04: Add workout history

See all your workouts for a specific exercise.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a history view where I can see all my workouts for a specific exercise. Show the date, weight, sets, and reps. Sort by most recent.
```

This is where the tool becomes useful. You can see if you're getting stronger.

---

## Step 05: Add progress tracking

See your personal bests and progress over time.

**Prompt:**
```
For each exercise, show my personal best (highest weight) and when I achieved it. Show a simple line chart of my progress over time.
```

**Tip:** If charts are ugly, ask Claude to use a specific charting style or library.

---

## Step 06: Add quick logging

Make repeat workouts faster to log.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a "repeat last workout" button that pre-fills today's form with what I did last time for this exercise.
```

This makes the tool faster to use. You're not typing the same numbers every session.

---

## Additional Prompts

**Rest timer:**
```
Add a rest timer that counts down between sets
```
*Use when you want to keep rest periods consistent.*

**Workout rating:**
```
Let me rate each workout 1-5 for how I felt
```
*Use when you want to track energy and recovery.*

**Body weight:**
```
Add body weight tracking as a separate log
```
*Use when you want to correlate weight with training.*

**Weekly volume:**
```
Show weekly volume (total sets × reps × weight)
```
*Use when you want to track overall training load.*

**CSV export:**
```
Export my workout data as CSV for spreadsheets
```
*Use when you want to analyze data elsewhere.*

---

## When Things Break

**Problem:** Wrong exercise template shows up or doesn't pre-fill correctly
**Likely cause:** Exercise names have typos or inconsistent capitalization
**Solution:** Standardize your exercise names. Ask Claude: "Make exercise names case-insensitive and suggest matches if I have a typo. For example, 'squat', 'Squat', and 'squats' should all map to the same exercise."

**Problem:** Progress chart displays incorrectly or shows wrong data
**Likely cause:** Axes are swapped or data isn't filtered properly
**Solution:** Tell Claude exactly what you expected. Say: "The Y-axis should show weight in pounds, X-axis should show dates. Right now it's showing [what it shows]. Here's what I want: [describe it]."

**Problem:** Data entry feels tedious and slow
**Likely cause:** Too much manual typing for common adjustments
**Solution:** Ask Claude for shortcuts: "Add +5 and -5 buttons next to the weight field so I can quickly adjust instead of typing. Do the same for reps."

**Problem:** Lost all my workout history
**Likely cause:** localStorage was cleared by browser or system cleanup
**Solution:** No automatic backup exists. Ask Claude: "Add an export button that saves all workout data to a JSON file. Add an import button to restore from backup. Remind me to export every 10 workouts."

**Problem:** Can't compare progress across different exercises
**Likely cause:** Charts only show one exercise at a time
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Let me compare progress for multiple exercises on the same chart. Add a multi-select so I can see my squat and deadlift trends together."

**Problem:** Forgot what weight I used last time for an exercise
**Likely cause:** No "last workout" reference visible during data entry
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "When I start logging an exercise, show me what weight and reps I used last time as a reference."

**Problem:** Charts show too much data and are hard to read
**Likely cause:** Showing all workouts without date range filtering
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Add date range filters to the charts. Let me view last week, last month, last 3 months, or all time."

---

## Reflection

After you've tracked for a few weeks, consider:
- Do you log during or after your workout?
- What patterns do you notice in your training?
- Does tracking change how you train?
- What would a trainer see in your data?

---

## Going Further

Ideas if you want to keep building:
- Add workout programs/plans
- Track rest days and recovery
- Add photos for form checks
- Integrate with a fitness API (complex)
- Build a companion Apple Watch app (very complex)

---

## On Tracking Movement

Most fitness apps want to turn every workout into a game. They give you points, badges, streaks. They want you to compete with friends. They want engagement.

This tool doesn't care if you work out. It doesn't celebrate when you do or guilt you when you don't. It just records what happened.

The value isn't in the tracking itself—it's in having an accurate record when you need it. When you wonder if you're getting stronger. When you want to know if that back tweak started before or after you increased the weight. When you're curious about your long-term patterns.

The tool serves you. You don't serve it.

---

**Next week:** Practice 05 - Collect (Record Shelf). A simple database for things you want to track: books, movies, albums, games, whatever matters to you.

See you then.


\newpage



# Week 8: Practice 05 - Collect (Record Shelf)

*This week: a catalog for your collection. Vinyl, books, tools, plants—whatever you collect. Not a marketplace, not a social app. Just a record of what you have.*

---

**Build:** Record Shelf
**Principle:** Physical things deserve digital memory

## Why Build This?

You collect something. Vinyl records, books, tools, plants, vintage cameras, sneakers, board games. The collection matters to you. Each piece has a story—where you got it, why you wanted it, how it fits with the others.

Discogs exists for records. Goodreads for books. LibraryThing. Cataloging apps. They let you track your collection online, see what others have, compare prices, get recommendations.

They also make your private collection public by default. They use your data to suggest purchases. They show you what your collection is "worth" based on market prices, turning curation into investment tracking. They're designed for collectors who think like traders, not for people who just want to remember what they have.

This tool is private. No one sees your collection unless you show them. No recommendations. No social features. No market prices (unless you specifically want that). Just a catalog that works how you think.

Practical benefits: you can browse your collection from anywhere. You remember what you have before buying a duplicate. You can lend things and remember who has what. You see patterns in what you've collected over time.

But mainly: you're treating your collection with the care it deserves. Digital memory for physical things.

## What You'll Build

A catalog for your collection where you:
- Add items with key details
- Include photos
- Browse and search
- Track what you want but don't have yet

We'll use vinyl records as the example, but you can adapt this to whatever you collect.

---

## Step 01: Define your collection

Tell Claude what you collect and what you want to track about each item.

**Prompt:**
```
Build me a vinyl record catalog. For each record I want to track: artist, album title, year, format (LP/EP/7"), condition, and notes. Show all records in a grid with album art. Store in localStorage.
```

**Tip:** Change the fields to match what YOU collect. Books? Tools? Sneakers? Make it yours.

Save as `record-shelf.html` and open it.

---

## Step 02: Add your first items

Add 5-10 real items from your collection. Take photos if you want. Notice what information matters to you.

Do you care about condition? Original pressing vs reissue? Where you bought it? What fields did you wish you had?

---

## Step 03: Add a want-list

Track what you're looking for but don't have yet.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a separate "Want List" section for records I want but don't own. Same fields, but marked as wanted. Let me move items from want-list to collection when I acquire them.
```

This is useful when you're at a record store or browsing online. You know what you're looking for.

---

## Step 04: Add search and filter

Find things quickly as your collection grows.

**Prompt:**
```
Add search that filters by artist or album title. Add filter buttons for format (show only LPs, only 7"s, etc.).
```

---

## Step 05: Add photos

Make it visual.

**Prompt:**
```
Let me add a photo for each record. Show it as the album cover in the grid view. Store images in localStorage as base64.
```

**Tip:** Large photos will slow things down. Ask Claude to resize them on upload.

---

## Step 06: Add collection stats

See your collection at a glance.

**Prompt:**
```
Show me stats: total records, breakdown by format, by decade, most common artist.
```

---

## Step 07: Connect to Discogs API

Stop typing everything manually. Discogs has a massive database of music releases—use it.

**Prompt:**
```
Add Discogs API integration. Let me search for a record by artist and title, show matching results from Discogs, and when I click one, auto-fill all the fields (artist, album, year, format, label, catalog number). Include the Discogs cover image. I'll need to add my Discogs API token.
```

**Tip:** Get a free Discogs API token at discogs.com/settings/developers. You don't need to create an "app"—just generate a personal token.

---

## Additional Prompts

**Random pick:**
```

## When Things Break

**Problem:** Page loads very slowly or freezes with many items
**Likely cause:** Images stored as base64 are making the app too large
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Compress uploaded images to max 200KB before storing. Resize images to a maximum width of 800px to reduce file size."

**Problem:** "Quota exceeded" error when adding new items
**Likely cause:** localStorage has a 5-10MB limit and you've hit it
**Solution:** You've stored too much data. Options: (1) Delete old items you don't need, (2) Ask Claude: "Add an export feature and warn me when I'm near the storage limit," or (3) Ask Claude: "Switch from localStorage to IndexedDB for larger storage capacity."

**Problem:** Can't find items even though they're in my collection
**Likely cause:** Search is case-sensitive or only searches titles
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make search case-insensitive and search across all fields (title, artist, year, notes). Show partial matches."

**Problem:** Discogs API returns "401 Unauthorized" error
**Likely cause:** API token is missing, incorrect, or expired
**Solution:** Go to discogs.com/settings/developers and generate a new personal access token. Copy it and tell Claude: "Replace the Discogs API token in my code with this new one: [paste token]."

**Problem:** Discogs search returns too many irrelevant results
**Likely cause:** Search query is too broad
**Solution:** Be more specific when searching. Include both artist AND album title. Add the release year if you know it. Example: "Radiohead OK Computer 1997" instead of just "OK Computer."

**Problem:** CORS errors when trying to use Discogs API
**Likely cause:** Browser blocks cross-origin requests from local files
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Add a simple proxy to handle Discogs API requests so I don't get CORS errors when running locally."

**Problem:** Grid layout looks uneven with different-sized covers
**Likely cause:** Album covers have different aspect ratios
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make all album covers display as the same size squares with consistent spacing. Crop images to fit if needed."

**Problem:** Accidentally added the wrong item and can't undo
**Likely cause:** No confirmation before deleting or editing
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Add a confirmation dialog before deleting items. Also add an edit button so I can fix mistakes without deleting and re-adding."

---

## Reflection

After you've cataloged your collection, consider:
- Does cataloging change how you see your collection?
- What items did you forget you had?
- Is your want-list realistic or aspirational?
- What would you tell someone about your collection based on the stats?

---

## Going Further

Ideas if you want to keep building:

**Barcode scanning (Advanced):**
Scan the barcode on records using your device camera and auto-fill details from Discogs. Note: This requires camera permissions, works best on mobile, and involves CORS considerations when calling the Discogs API. Ask Claude: "Add barcode scanning using the device camera. When I scan a barcode, search Discogs for that barcode and auto-fill the record details."

**Other extensions:**
- Two-way Discogs sync (changes in your app update Discogs and vice versa)
- Price history charts (track value changes over time)
- Lending tracker (who has your stuff and for how long)
- Print labels for physical organization (spines, dividers)
- Audio fingerprinting to identify unlabeled records
- Export to CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Integration with Last.fm to auto-track plays

---

## On Collecting

Collecting is a form of curation. You choose what matters enough to keep. You organize it. You remember where you got each piece.

Digital catalogs don't replace the physical experience. You still need to flip through the stack, pull something out, hold it. But having a searchable record means you can browse your collection from anywhere. You can remember what you have before you buy a duplicate. You can see patterns in what you've been drawn to over time.

This tool respects the collection. It doesn't try to monetize it or turn it into content. It just helps you remember.

**Next week:** Practice 06 - See (Photo Log). A simple visual journal. Take a photo each day. Build up a grid over time. See your life in images.

See you then.


\newpage



# Week 9: See (Practice 06: Photo Log)

*Week 9 of Field Guide. You've built tools for capturing links, remembering thoughts, tracking movement, and collecting records. This week: a tool for seeing more clearly.*

---

## Attention as Practice

Masahiro Mori wrote about robots performing tasks with "perfect, selfless devotion." What would that look like for humans?

Photography teacher Minor White said: "Be still with yourself until the object of your attention affirms your presence."

The three questions in this practice force that stillness:
- What caught your eye?
- What were you trying to capture?
- What do you see now that you look again?

This is about training attention. The camera becomes a tool for noticing—like how a robot's mechanical precision can reveal principles of the universe.

You're trying to see clearly. The tool (camera, questions, Claude) helps you pay attention in a way you might not naturally.

---

## Practice 06: See

**Build:** Photo Log
**Principle:** Photography as attention practice

### Why Build This?

You already have Apple Photos. Google Photos. Instagram. VSCO. Day One with photo attachments. Your phone automatically organizes photos by date, face recognition, and location.

These tools are good at storage and organization. They're not good at reflection. Apple Photos shows you "Memories" you didn't ask for. Instagram shows you likes and compares your photos to others. Google Photos uses your images to train AI models.

More importantly: none of them slow you down enough to actually see what you photographed. You take a photo, it goes into a grid with 10,000 others, you never look at it again. The photo becomes proof you were somewhere, not a record of what you noticed.

This tool forces you to look twice. Once when you take the photo (what caught your eye?). Again when you answer the reflection questions (what do you see now?). The questions create a gap between capture and consumption. That gap is where seeing happens.

No social features. No likes. No comparison to other photographers. No algorithmic "Memories." Just your photos and your observations. The tool disappears. The practice remains.

### What You'll Build

A visual journal that pairs photos with reflection. Not Instagram. Not a portfolio. A tool for noticing what you notice.

Features:
- Upload a photo
- Answer three reflection questions
- View all your entries in a grid
- Click to see photo full-size with reflections
- Optional: date-based browsing
- Storage: localStorage for reflections, base64 for images (keeps everything self-contained)

### Why This Tool

Most photo apps optimize for sharing, likes, engagement. They turn photography into performance.

This tool is private. No one sees it but you. The questions force you to slow down and look at what you photographed.

Photography trains you to see. This tool supports that practice.

### Step 01: Describe the basic structure

**Prompt to copy:**

```
I want to build a photo journal as a single HTML file.

Features:
- Upload a photo
- Display the photo as a preview
- Three text areas for reflection questions:
  1. What caught your eye?
  2. What were you trying to capture?
  3. What do you see now that you look again?
- Save button to store the photo and reflections
- Display all entries as a grid of thumbnails
- Click a thumbnail to view full photo + reflections
- Store everything in localStorage (convert images to base64)

Keep design minimal and focused on the images.
```

### Step 02: Test the basics

Save as `photos.html` and open it.

Try:
- Uploading a photo (any photo from your computer)
- Answering the three questions
- Saving the entry
- Uploading another photo
- Clicking a thumbnail to view full entry

Does it work? Can you see both entries?

### Step 03: Improve the grid layout

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Update the grid:
- Make thumbnails larger (200px square)
- Add subtle borders and shadows to each thumbnail
- Show the date below each thumbnail
- Add hover effect (slight zoom when mouse hovers over thumbnail)
- Make the grid responsive (fewer columns on smaller screens)
```

Test: Does the grid feel good to browse? Can you see enough of each photo?

### Step 04: Add full-view modal

**Prompt to copy:**

```
When I click a thumbnail:
- Show the full image in a modal/overlay
- Display the three reflection questions and answers below the image
- Show the date
- Add close button (X in corner)
- Clicking outside the modal should close it
- Add Previous/Next buttons to browse through entries
```

Test: Can you browse through all your entries using the arrows? Does the modal close properly?

### Step 05: Add filtering and search

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Add these features:
- Search box that filters entries based on reflection text
- Date picker to show only entries from a specific month
- Option to sort by newest/oldest
- Show count of total entries
```

### Extensions (Optional)

**Photo metadata:**
```
Extract and display EXIF data from uploaded photos:
- Camera make/model
- Date taken
- Settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed if available)
```

**Tags and categories:**
```
Add optional tags to each entry.
Show tag cloud.
Filter by tag.
```

**Export:**
```
Add export button that:
- Creates HTML page with all photos and reflections
- Generates PDF of all entries
- Downloads all photos as ZIP
```

**Editing:**
```
Add edit button to each entry to update reflections without re-uploading photo.
```

**Location:**
```
If photo has GPS data, show where it was taken on a small map.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Page loads extremely slowly when viewing photo log
**Likely cause:** Base64-encoded images are too large and bloating the file
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Resize uploaded images to max 1200px width before converting to base64. Compress images to reduce file size while maintaining quality."

**Problem:** "Quota exceeded" error when adding new photos
**Likely cause:** localStorage has a 5-10MB limit; photos fill this quickly
**Solution:** You've hit the storage limit. Options: (1) Delete old entries, (2) Ask Claude: "Limit the photo log to 50 most recent entries," or (3) Ask Claude: "Switch to IndexedDB instead of localStorage for much larger storage capacity."

**Problem:** Photos appear rotated incorrectly
**Likely cause:** EXIF orientation data isn't being read from the image
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Read and apply EXIF orientation data so photos display with the correct rotation."

**Problem:** Modal viewer doesn't close on mobile devices
**Likely cause:** Close button is too small or tap target isn't responsive
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make the modal close button much larger and easier to tap on mobile. Increase the tap target size to at least 44x44 pixels."

**Problem:** Can't navigate between photos in the modal viewer
**Likely cause:** No prev/next functionality in modal
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Add left and right arrows in the modal so I can navigate to the previous and next photos without closing the modal."

**Problem:** Photos look pixelated or low quality
**Likely cause:** Images are being compressed too aggressively
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Increase image quality during compression. Use 0.9 quality for JPEG compression instead of lower values."

**Problem:** Takes too long to upload and process photos
**Likely cause:** Large images are being processed in the main thread
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Show a loading indicator while images are being processed. Process images asynchronously so the UI doesn't freeze."

**Problem:** Want to add multiple photos at once
**Likely cause:** File input only accepts one photo at a time
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Allow multiple photo uploads. Let me select several photos at once and add them all with the same reflection notes."

## Reflection

Minor White taught photography as spiritual practice. The camera doesn't capture reality—it reveals what you're paying attention to.

The three questions in this tool aren't random:

**What caught your eye?** Forces you to notice what drew you initially. Often you don't know why something interests you until you articulate it.

**What were you trying to capture?** Your intention. What you thought you saw. This is usually different from what's actually in the photo.

**What do you see now?** Looking again, with more attention. This is where the practice is—training yourself to look past your first impression.

Mori believed robots revealed universal principles through mechanical precision. Photography works similarly—it fixes a moment so you can see it more clearly than you did when you were there.

This tool supports that seeing. It makes you more attentive to what you photograph.

Some questions:
- Do the three prompts help or hinder your reflection?
- Would you use this regularly, or just occasionally?
- What would make this feel more like practice and less like work?

The best tools shape behavior gently. If answering three questions feels like a chore, maybe one question is enough. Or maybe just the photo and a date. Adjust until it feels sustainable.

## Next Week

Practice 07: Gather. You'll build a personal dashboard—bringing together weather, tasks, links, and whatever else you want to see when you open your browser. Your digital home screen.

---

**Note:** If you're not a photographer, that's fine. The practice here is about attention, not photography. You could adapt this tool for any kind of visual collection: drawings, designs, screenshots, things you notice. The structure works for anything you want to look at and reflect on.


\newpage



# Week 10: Gather (Practice 07: Dashboard)

*Week 10 of Field Guide. You've built individual tools—each one focused on a specific task. This week: bring them together into a single home screen.*

---

## Finding Your Place

Gary Snyder: "Find your place on the planet. Dig in, and take responsibility from there."

He means this literally—choose a location, learn it deeply, commit to it. Know the watershed, the weather patterns, the plants and animals. Become native to where you are.

Your dashboard is the digital equivalent. It's your home screen. Your daily starting point. What you see when you open a browser.

Most people's home screen: whatever Google or their browser decided for them. Generic news. Trending topics. Someone else's idea of what matters.

Your dashboard: what YOU need to see. The weather where you are. Your tasks. Your links. Maybe a quote that grounds you.

This is taking responsibility for your digital place. Curating what you encounter daily instead of accepting defaults.

Small? Yes. But Snyder's entire philosophy is: small, consistent choices about how you live matter more than grand gestures.

Your dashboard is one of those choices.

---

## Practice 07: Gather

**Build:** Personal Dashboard
**Principle:** Curating your digital home

### Why Build This?

Your browser's default homepage shows: Google search, trending news, ads disguised as articles, "recommendations" based on your browsing history, weather for a city you don't live in.

Start page services exist: Momentum, Tabliss, Dayboard. They're prettier than the defaults. They show inspirational quotes, beautiful photos, time and weather. They also track your data, require accounts, show ads, or cost $5/month.

Most people never question this. They accept that opening a browser means seeing whatever Google or some startup decided to show them.

This tool changes that. When you open your browser, you see exactly what you put there. Your weather. Your links. Your tasks. Maybe a quote you chose. Nothing algorithmic. Nothing trending. Nothing trying to capture your attention for someone else's benefit.

Practical effect: you reclaim the most frequent moment in your digital life—opening a browser tab. Instead of being thrown into someone else's attention economy, you land in a space you designed.

Set it as your homepage. Every new tab becomes your space. Calm. Intentional. Yours.

### What You'll Build

A customizable start page that shows what matters to you when you open your browser.

Features:
- Weather for your location
- Quick links (the links you actually use)
- Today's date
- Simple task list
- Optional: time, quote of the day, calendar, notes
- Storage: localStorage for tasks and links
- Set as your browser's homepage

### Why This Tool

Browser homepages are real estate. Most people give it away to Google or their browser's new tab page. You get news you never requested, trending searches, sponsored content.

Your dashboard is yours. No ads. No algorithms. Just what you want to see every day.

This is about starting your day with intention instead of distraction.

### Step 01: Describe the basic layout

**Prompt to copy:**

```
I want to build a personal dashboard as a single HTML file.

Layout:
- Top: current date and time
- Left side: weather for Portland, Oregon (use a free weather API)
- Center: quick links section with my most-used websites
- Right side: simple task list
- Bottom: optional quote of the day

Features:
- Save links and tasks to localStorage
- Auto-update time every second
- Refresh weather every hour
- Clean, minimal design with calm colors
- Should work as browser homepage

Make it work as a standalone file.
```

### Step 02: Test the structure

Save as `dashboard.html` and open it.

Check:
- Does the time update?
- Does weather load? (You might need an API key—Claude will tell you how to get one)
- Can you add links and tasks?
- Do they persist after refresh?

### Step 03: Customize for your location and needs

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Updates:
- Change weather to my location: [Your City, State/Country]
- Add these quick links:
  [List your actual links: Gmail, Calendar, GitHub, etc.]
- Change color scheme to:
  Background: warm beige (#F5F1E8)
  Text: dark brown (#3E3022)
  Accents: forest green (#4A7C59)
```

Test: Does it feel like yours now? Does the weather match where you are?

### Step 04: Add widgets

**Prompt to copy:**

```
Add these optional sections:
- Mini calendar showing current month
- Notes section for quick thoughts
- Countdown to an important date I set
- Last updated timestamp for weather
```

Pick what you'll actually use. Don't add complexity you don't need.

### Step 05: Make it your browser homepage

This depends on your browser:

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Settings → On startup → Open a specific page
2. Add `file:///path/to/your/dashboard.html`

**Firefox:**
1. Settings → Home → Homepage and new windows
2. Custom URLs → Add your file path

**Safari:**
1. Preferences → General → Homepage
2. Set to your file path

Test: Open a new browser window. Does your dashboard appear?

### Extensions (Optional)

**RSS feeds:**
```
Add RSS feed reader showing latest posts from blogs I follow.
Let me add/remove feeds.
Show last 5 posts from each feed.
```

**Pomodoro timer:**
```
Add work/break timer.
25-minute work sessions, 5-minute breaks.
Play sound when time is up.
```

**Habit tracker:**
```
Daily checkboxes for habits I'm tracking.
Shows streak count.
Resets at midnight.
```

**Bookmarks from your link catcher:**
```
Pull in recent links from your link catcher tool.
Show most recent 10.
Click to open in new tab.
```

**GitHub/work integration:**
```
Show my open pull requests.
Show today's calendar events.
Requires API setup.
```

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Weather widget shows an error or doesn't load
**Likely cause:** Missing or invalid API key for the weather service
**Solution:** Free weather APIs require an API key. Claude will tell you which API it's using. Get a free key from that service, then tell Claude: "Replace the weather API key with this one: [paste your key]."

**Problem:** Dashboard doesn't load when set as browser homepage
**Likely cause:** Incorrect file path in browser settings
**Solution:** You need the full `file://` path. On Mac: right-click the file and select "Get Info" to copy the full path. On Windows: shift+right-click and select "Copy as path." Paste this complete path into your browser's homepage setting.

**Problem:** Clock doesn't update or shows wrong time
**Likely cause:** JavaScript error preventing the time update function
**Solution:** Open the browser console (press F12) and check for errors. Copy any error messages and ask Claude: "The time isn't updating. Here's the error I'm seeing: [paste error]."

**Problem:** Dashboard takes 10+ seconds to load
**Likely cause:** Making too many API calls every time the page loads
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Cache API data so it doesn't fetch on every load. Only refresh weather if more than 1 hour has passed. Cache other data appropriately."

**Problem:** Links to other tools don't work
**Likely cause:** Wrong file paths or links weren't updated after moving files
**Solution:** Make sure all your tool HTML files are in the same folder. Ask Claude: "Update all links to use relative paths so they work regardless of where I move the folder."

**Problem:** Dashboard looks wrong on mobile
**Likely cause:** Layout isn't responsive or components don't scale
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Make the dashboard fully responsive. Stack widgets vertically on mobile instead of side-by-side. Ensure text and buttons are readable on small screens."

**Problem:** Want to add/remove widgets but don't know how
**Likely cause:** Need to understand the dashboard structure
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Show me how to add a new widget to the dashboard. Explain the structure so I can customize which widgets appear."

**Problem:** Weather shows wrong location
**Likely cause:** Using IP-based location detection or hardcoded coordinates
**Solution:** Ask Claude: "Let me set my location manually. Add a settings section where I can enter my city or zip code for weather."

## Reflection

Snyder's work was about place-based practice. Living somewhere long enough to know it deeply. Taking responsibility for that specific location.

Your dashboard is the same idea, digital. It's not trying to show you everything. It's showing you what matters in your specific life.

Some questions:
- What do you actually need to see every day?
- What's on your dashboard that you never look at?
- Is this more useful than a blank page, or less?

The best dashboards evolve. What you need in January might not be what you need in July. Let it change.

The worst dashboards try to do everything. Focus, task list, calendar, news, weather, email, social feeds—it becomes noise.

Keep it simple. Show what grounds you. Remove what doesn't.

## Integration of Perspectives

Snyder: "The mercy of the West has been social revolution; the mercy of the East has been individual insight into the basic self/void. We need both."

When you deploy a tool online, you choose between:
- **Western approach:** Scale it, share it, make it public, change the world
- **Eastern approach:** Keep it private, use it yourself, refine through personal practice

Both are valid. Do what serves the tool's purpose.

Your dashboard is intensely personal. It probably works best staying local—on your computer, not online. But if you want it accessible from multiple devices, deploying makes sense.

The question is: does shipping serve the tool?

Ship when it makes the tool more useful to you or the people you care about.

## Next Week

Guide 04: Shipping. How to deploy your tools online using Vercel (free). When to deploy, when to keep things local, and how to make tools accessible from anywhere.

---

**Note:** Not everyone needs a dashboard. If opening a blank page feels better than seeing widgets, that's valid. The practice here is about intentional choice—whatever you choose, choose it deliberately.


\newpage



# Week 11: Shipping

*Week 11 of Field Guide. You've built seven tools. They work on your computer. This week: how to deploy them online so they work anywhere.*

---

## Fragility and Interconnection

Jean Boulton emphasizes that we live in an "interconnected and fragile world" where small acts matter.

When you deploy a tool online, you're entering this interconnection. Your tool becomes part of:
- The web (connected to everything)
- Infrastructure (dependent on services staying online)
- Other people (if you share it)
- Maintenance (it will need care)

This is reality. It informs how you approach shipping.

**Ship small.** Don't try to build a platform. Build one tool that does one thing.

**Ship for yourself first.** Know it works in your hands before sharing.

**Accept fragility.** Things break. Services change. URLs die. Your tool needs to work now, not last forever.

**Choose appropriate complexity.** Match the tool's complexity to its actual use. Skip authentication if you're the only user. Skip scaling if you have five users.

The traditional tech mindset: build once, scale infinitely, last forever. Most tools are temporary responses to current needs.

Accept this. It makes building simpler and shipping faster.

---

## Guide 04: Shipping Your Tools

**When to deploy online:**
- You want to access it from multiple devices
- You're sharing it with others
- It uses APIs that require HTTPS
- It needs to be publicly linkable

**When to keep it local:**
- It contains private data (journal, personal notes)
- You're still iterating heavily
- It works fine as a local file
- Deploying adds no value

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

Free, fast, designed for single-page apps. Perfect for Field Guide tools.

**Step 01: Install Vercel CLI**

Open your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

If you don't have npm installed, download Node.js from nodejs.org first (it includes npm).

**Step 02: Navigate to your project**

```bash
cd path/to/your/tool
```

For example: `cd Documents/field-guide/link-catcher`

**Step 03: Deploy**

```bash
vercel
```

Vercel will ask:
- Set up and deploy? → Yes
- Which scope? → Your account
- Link to existing project? → No
- Project name? → link-catcher (or whatever)
- Directory? → ./ (current directory)
- Override settings? → No

It'll deploy and give you a URL like: `link-catcher.vercel.app`

Open that URL. Your tool is live.

**Step 04: Update when you make changes**

```bash
vercel --prod
```

This deploys your latest changes.

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

Free static hosting from GitHub.

**Step 01: Create a GitHub account**

If you don't have one: github.com → Sign up

**Step 02: Create a new repository**

- Click "New repository"
- Name it (e.g., "link-catcher")
- Make it Public
- Don't initialize with README
- Create repository

**Step 03: Upload your file**

- Click "uploading an existing file"
- Drag your .html file
- Commit changes

**Step 04: Enable GitHub Pages**

- Go to repository Settings
- Scroll to Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch → main
- Save

Your tool will be live at: `yourusername.github.io/link-catcher`

Rename your file to `index.html` if it isn't already.

### Option 3: Netlify Drop

Simplest option—literally drag and drop.

**Step 01: Go to Netlify Drop**

Visit: app.netlify.com/drop

**Step 02: Drag your file**

Drag your .html file onto the page.

**Step 03: Get your URL**

Netlify generates a random URL like: `quirky-name-123.netlify.app`

You can customize this URL in settings (free).

### Which Service to Use?

**Vercel:** Best for tools you'll update frequently. Command-line deployment is fast once you're set up.

**GitHub Pages:** Best if you already use GitHub or want version control.

**Netlify Drop:** Best for quick one-off deployments or testing if deployment works.

All three are free for personal projects. Pick what feels easiest.

## Security Basics

Before you deploy, understand these security fundamentals:

### API Keys and Secrets

**What they are:** API keys are passwords that let your tool access external services (Discogs, weather APIs, etc.).

**The problem:** If you commit an API key to a public GitHub repository, anyone can see it and use it. This can result in:
- Your API quota getting used up
- Your account getting banned
- Charges to your credit card (if using paid APIs)

**How to protect them:**

1. **Never hardcode API keys in your code:**
   ```javascript
   // BAD - visible to anyone
   const API_KEY = "abc123xyz789";
   ```

2. **Use environment variables** (Vercel/Netlify):
   - Store keys in the deployment platform's settings
   - Access them as `process.env.API_KEY`
   - Ask Claude: "Move my API key to an environment variable"

3. **For GitHub:** Add a `.gitignore` file listing files with secrets:
   ```
   .env
   config.js
   secrets.txt
   ```

### localStorage Privacy

**What it is:** Data saved in localStorage is stored in the user's browser.

**The privacy reality:**
- Anyone with access to the user's computer can read localStorage using browser dev tools (F12 → Application → Local Storage)
- Data is NOT encrypted by default
- Data persists until explicitly cleared

**What this means:**
- localStorage is fine for casual data (links, todos, workout logs)
- localStorage is NOT secure for sensitive data (passwords, financial info, medical records)

**If you need real privacy:**
- Add a password that encrypts data before saving
- Ask Claude: "Add password protection that encrypts all localStorage data"
- Or keep the tool local (don't deploy it)

### HTTPS Requirements

Some browser features ONLY work on HTTPS (secure) connections:
- Camera access (barcode scanning, photo taking)
- Geolocation
- Clipboard access
- Notifications

**Good news:** Vercel, GitHub Pages, and Netlify all provide HTTPS automatically. If you're using a custom domain, HTTPS is also automatic.

**Local testing:** Use `http://localhost` for testing—browsers allow these features on localhost even without HTTPS.

### Basic Authentication (Optional)

If you want to restrict who can access your deployed tool:

**Ask Claude:**
```
Add basic password protection to this page. Anyone visiting should
need to enter a password before seeing the tool. Store the hashed
password securely.
```

**Note:** This is light protection, suitable for keeping casual visitors out. For real security, you need proper user authentication (beyond this course's scope).

### When Security Matters

**Low security needs:**
- Link catcher (public links)
- Workout tracker (workout data)
- Photo journal (casual photos)

**Medium security needs:**
- Daily journal (personal thoughts)
- Private collections

**High security needs:**
- Medical records
- Financial data
- Passwords/credentials

**Rule of thumb:** If losing the data would cause real harm, either:
1. Add proper encryption
2. Keep it local (don't deploy)
3. Use a proper secure service instead

### Summary

- Never commit API keys to public repositories
- localStorage is visible to anyone with computer access
- HTTPS is automatic on modern deployment platforms
- Add password protection only if you actually need it
- Match security effort to actual risk

## Making Tools Shareable

If you're deploying a tool for other people to use:

### Add Instructions

Create a simple README section at the top of your page:

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
Add a collapsible "How to Use" section at the top of the page that:
- Explains what this tool does
- Lists the features
- Shows an example
- Starts collapsed (click to expand)
```

### Remove Personal Data

Before deploying:

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
Clear all my personal data from the tool:
- Remove my saved links/entries
- Clear localStorage on first load
- Show empty state with example data
```

### Add Privacy Notice

If your tool stores data:

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
Add a privacy notice:
- All data stored locally in browser
- Nothing sent to servers
- Clearing browser data deletes everything
- Show this in small text at bottom
```

## Common Deployment Issues

**Tool works locally but breaks online**
File paths may be incorrect. Ask Claude: "Fix all file paths to work when deployed online."

**API calls fail**  
Many APIs require HTTPS. Local files use `file://` which doesn't work with APIs. Deploying to Vercel/Netlify gives you HTTPS.

**Fonts don't load**
Using custom fonts requires loading them from CDN (like Google Fonts), not local files.

**Styles look different**  
Some browsers handle local files differently than hosted ones. Test on the deployed version and ask Claude to fix any issues.

**Need authentication**
For private tools with sensitive data, keep them local or use password protection (ask Claude to implement basic auth). Avoid public deployment.

## When NOT to Deploy

**Your journal** - Keep it local. Private data shouldn't be online unless you have proper authentication.

**Tools still in development** - Wait until they work reliably before deploying.

**Tools only you use** - If local file works fine, deployment adds complexity without benefit.

**Anything with API keys** - Never commit API keys to public repositories. Use environment variables (ask Claude how).

## Updating Deployed Tools

After deployment, you'll keep making improvements.

**Vercel workflow:**
1. Edit your local file
2. Test locally
3. Run `vercel --prod`
4. Changes are live

**GitHub Pages workflow:**
1. Edit your local file
2. Test locally
3. Upload new version to GitHub
4. Wait ~1 minute for deployment

**Netlify workflow:**
1. Edit your local file
2. Test locally
3. Drag new file to Netlify Drop
4. Get new URL (or connect it to git for automatic deployments)

## Next Steps

**Custom Domain (Optional)**

All three services let you use custom domains:
- Buy a domain (from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- Point it to your deployment
- Follow service instructions for DNS setup

Cost: ~$12/year for a domain.

**Analytics (Optional)**

Want to know if anyone uses your tool?
- Add Simple Analytics or Plausible (privacy-friendly)
- Or just check service analytics (Vercel/Netlify provide basic stats)

**Make Tools Private**

If deploying for yourself but want it password-protected:
- Vercel: Add basic auth via vercel.json
- Netlify: Add password protection in settings
- GitHub Pages: Doesn't support auth (keep it local or use other services)

## Reflection

Boulton talks about small acts in interconnected systems. Deploying a tool is a small act. You're making something accessible.

But accessible can mean different things. Sometimes the right choice is keeping it local, on your machine, private.

The question to ask:
**Does deploying make this tool more useful to me or the people I care about?**

If yes, deploy. If no, keep it local.

Deploy when it serves the tool's purpose.

Some tools are meant to be shared. Others are meant to be personal. Both are valid.

### On Impermanence and Compassion

Everything you build will eventually break or become obsolete. APIs change. Services shut down. Browsers evolve. The code that works today might not work in five years.

This feels like failure. In Buddhist teaching, it's just anicca—impermanence. Everything that arises passes away. Tools. Services. Even your needs change.

The practice is responding skillfully to changing needs, again and again. Building the next tool when this one no longer serves. Fixing what breaks. Letting go when it's time.

When you build clearly and simply, you practice compassion toward your future self who will maintain these tools. When you document what a tool does, when you keep the code readable, when you avoid unnecessary complexity—you're reducing future suffering.

If you build for others—even just one other person—you practice karuna (compassion). You're reducing frustration with bad tools for someone who shares your problem.

The tools are temporary. The practice of building with attention and care is what persists.

## Next Week

Practice 08: Refine. Go back to one of your tools. Use it for a week. Notice friction. Fix it based on real use, not imagined problems.

This is where taste develops—not through planning, but through sustained attention to what actually works.

---

**Note:** If deployment feels overwhelming, skip it. All your tools work fine as local files. You can always come back and deploy later when you need to.

# Week 12: Refine (Practice 08: Revisit + Improve)

*Week 12 of Field Guide. You've built eight tools. You've learned the loop. This week: go back to something you use and make it better based on real friction.*

---

## Patterns Over Solutions

Jean Boulton distinguishes between "making sense" (understanding patterns) and "jumping to solutions."

When you revisit a tool to refine it, resist the urge to immediately add features. Instead:

1. **Use it consistently** for a week
2. **Notice patterns** in when it works and when it frustrates you
3. **Name the friction** specifically
4. **Understand why** it's friction (not just that it is)
5. **Then** ask Claude for a solution

Most people skip to step 5. They know something feels wrong and immediately want to fix it. The fix works when you understand the pattern.

Example:
- **Bad:** "This search is annoying. Add filters."
- **Good:** "I search for the same tags repeatedly. The search doesn't remember my last search. This means I type the same thing 5 times a day. Add a 'search history' dropdown that shows my last 5 searches."

The second version emerges from pattern recognition. You've watched yourself use the tool. You've noticed repetition. You've understood *why* it frustrates you.

This is slower upfront but produces better results. You respond to observed patterns rather than feature-creeping.

## The Path of Meditation

Gary Snyder outlined a three-fold path for what he called the "Dharma revolutionary": wisdom, meditation, and morality.

**Wisdom:** Understanding how things work  
**Meditation:** Sustained attention to what is  
**Morality:** Acting in accordance with understanding

Refining a tool follows this pattern:

**Wisdom** → Use the tool consistently, notice patterns, understand what's actually wrong (not just that something feels off)

**Meditation** → Sustained attention to how you interact with the tool, what causes friction, what flows smoothly

**Morality** → Act on what you learned—fix what matters, ignore feature creep, respect the tool's purpose

Most people skip to action without wisdom or attention. They add features randomly. They chase shiny improvements.

The practice: use, notice, understand, then act. This takes longer but produces better tools.

---

## Practice 08: Refine

**Build:** Nothing new—improve something old  
**Principle:** Pattern recognition over feature addition

### What You'll Do

Pick one tool you've built and actually used. Not the one you're most proud of—the one you've opened most often.

Spend this week using it with full attention. Notice every friction point. Then fix what actually matters.

### Step 01: Choose your tool

Look at what you've built:
- Personal page
- Link catcher
- Daily log
- Training tracker
- Record shelf
- Photo log
- Dashboard

**Which one have you opened most?** That's your candidate.

If you haven't used any of them, pick the one you *want* to use but haven't because something about it feels off.

### Step 02: Use it with attention

For one week, use this tool daily. Keep a notes file open and write down:

**Every time you use it:**
- What task were you trying to complete?
- What worked smoothly?
- Where did you pause or hesitate?
- What made you think "I wish this..."?

**Don't fix anything yet.** Just observe.

Example observations:
- "I wanted to add a link but had to scroll to find the form"
- "Search is case-sensitive, missed results I wanted"
- "Can't remember what tags I've used before"
- "Takes 3 clicks to delete an entry, should be 1"
- "Text is too small on my phone"

### Step 03: Identify patterns

After a week, read your notes. Look for patterns:

**Repetitive friction:** Same problem every time you use it  
**Missing information:** Something you always wish was visible  
**Extra steps:** Tasks that take more clicks than they should  
**Unclear state:** Not knowing if something worked or not

Pick the top 3 most frequent friction points. Fix those.

### Step 04: Describe solutions

For each friction point, describe a specific fix:

**Pattern:** "I search for the same tags every day"  
**Solution:** "Add a 'popular tags' section showing my 5 most-used tags as clickable buttons"

**Pattern:** "I forget what I named things and can't find them"  
**Solution:** "Add autocomplete to the search that shows suggestions as I type"

**Pattern:** "Form is at bottom, have to scroll every time"  
**Solution:** "Make the form sticky at the top so it's always visible"

### Step 05: Implement one at a time

Go to Claude with ONE fix at a time:

**Prompt example:**

```
I've been using my link catcher daily and noticed I search for the same tags repeatedly.

Current behavior: I have to type "design" or "research" every time I want to filter

Desired behavior: Show my 5 most-used tags as clickable buttons above the search box. Clicking a tag should filter to show only links with that tag.

Can you add this feature?
```

Test it. Does it solve the problem? If yes, move to the next fix. If no, try a different approach.

### Step 06: Test your improvements for another week

Use the improved tool for another week. Did your changes help?

**If yes:** The pattern recognition worked. You fixed real friction.

**If no:** You fixed the wrong thing or the solution missed the problem. Go back to observation.

## Common Refinement Patterns

After doing this with many tools, you'll notice common improvements:

### Better Feedback

**Problem:** Not sure if action succeeded  
**Solution:** Add confirmation messages, loading states, success animations

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
When I save an entry, I'm not sure if it worked.
Add a brief success message that appears and fades out after 2 seconds.
```

### Smarter Defaults

**Problem:** Setting the same values repeatedly  
**Solution:** Remember last-used settings

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
I always set the same category when adding entries.
Make the category dropdown remember my last selection.
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Problem:** Too much clicking  
**Solution:** Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
I add 10-20 links per day. Clicking "Save" is tedious.
Add a keyboard shortcut: Enter to save when focused on the form.
```

### Mobile Optimization

**Problem:** Hard to use on phone  
**Solution:** Responsive design improvements

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
The search box is too small to tap on mobile.
Make all interactive elements at least 44px tall for easier tapping.
Add mobile-specific layout with larger fonts.
```

### Reduced Clutter

**Problem:** Too much information visible  
**Solution:** Progressive disclosure

**Prompt to Claude:**

```
The page feels overwhelming with all entries visible.
Show only 10 entries at first, with "Load More" button.
Or add pagination (10 per page).
```

## What NOT to Refine

**Don't add features just because you can.**

Ask yourself:
- Would this make the tool simpler or more complex?
- Does this solve a real problem I've encountered, or an imagined one?
- Will I actually use this feature, or does it just sound cool?

If a feature doesn't solve real friction you've experienced, skip it.

The best tools do one thing well. Don't turn your link catcher into a project management system just because you could.

## Troubleshooting Refinements

**Problem:** I made changes and now the tool is worse than before
**Likely cause:** Added complexity without improving the core experience
**Solution:** Revert the change. Save a copy of your working version before making changes. Ask Claude: "Undo that last change. Go back to how it was before I added [feature]."

**Problem:** The tool feels bloated and harder to use now
**Likely cause:** You added too many features you don't actually need
**Solution:** Remove features you haven't used in the past week. Ask Claude: "Remove the [feature] completely. Simplify the interface back to just the essential functions."

**Problem:** Can't decide which improvement to make first
**Likely cause:** Too many ideas, no clear priority
**Solution:** Pick the friction point that annoys you most often. Ask yourself: "What do I complain about every time I use this?" Fix that one thing first.

**Problem:** My improvement list keeps growing and nothing gets done
**Likely cause:** Trying to fix everything instead of focusing
**Solution:** Pick only the top 3 issues. Fix those. Leave the rest. The tool needs to work well enough, not be perfect. Ask Claude to address one specific issue at a time.

**Problem:** Refinement broke existing functionality
**Likely cause:** Didn't test the change across the whole tool
**Solution:** Test every change immediately. If something breaks, ask Claude: "The [feature] stopped working after I added [new feature]. Here's the error: [paste error]. Fix this without removing the new feature."

**Problem:** Don't know if a change actually improved things
**Likely cause:** No clear success criteria for the refinement
**Solution:** Before making changes, define what "better" means. Use the tool for a day, note the friction, then make one change and use it for another day. Compare before and after.

## Reflection

Boulton's point about understanding patterns before jumping to solutions is critical. Most people know something's wrong and immediately try to fix it. Without understanding the pattern, the fix often misses the mark.

Snyder's three-fold path (wisdom, meditation, morality) applies here: use the tool (meditation), understand the friction (wisdom), then act on that understanding (morality).

This is slower than just adding features randomly. It produces tools that actually get better, not just more complex.

Some questions:
- Did your improvements actually help, or did they just add complexity?
- What patterns emerged that you didn't expect?
- Which tool surprised you by being more useful than you thought?
- Which tool did you abandon? Why?

Not every tool you build will become essential. Some are learning exercises. Some solve temporary problems. Some you outgrow.

The practice is paying attention to what serves you and what doesn't.

## Next Week

Practice 09: Make Your Own + Prompt Library. The final practice. No template. No requirements. Build whatever you want. Plus: the complete prompt library with 50+ templates for every situation.

This is where you prove to yourself that you can build anything you need.

---

**Note:** If none of your tools need refinement because you haven't used them, that's valuable data. It means either: (1) the problems they solved were imaginary, or (2) the tools clash with how you work. Both are fine. Learning what you lack interest in is as valuable as learning what you need.
