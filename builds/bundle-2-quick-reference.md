# Field Guide Advanced - Quick Reference

## Essential Commands

### Starting a New Tool
```
Describe what you want > Claude generates code > Save as HTML > Open in browser
```

### The Loop
1. **Describe**: Tell Claude what you want (not how to build it)
2. **Generate**: Copy the code into your editor
3. **Test**: Open in browser, does it work?
4. **Refine**: Tell Claude what to fix, repeat

### Best Practices
- Start simple, add features one at a time
- Test after each change
- Save working versions before major changes
- Store data in localStorage for personal tools
- Keep tools as single HTML files when possible

**Remember:** You don't need to become a developer. You just need to build what you need.
