## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**Do:** ✅ Start simple, improve as you go ✅ Engage authentically with every subscriber ✅ Share student work (with permission) ✅ Ask for feedback and actually use it ✅ Be honest when you don't know something

**Don't:** ❌ Over-promise on timeline ❌ Add features mid-course (confuses people) ❌ Compare yourself to huge courses ❌ Disappear when it gets hard ❌ Forget to celebrate small wins

---

## EMERGENCY CONTACTS

**If something breaks:**

- Substack support: support@substack.com
- Your backup plan: [write down who you can call for tech help]

**If you get overwhelmed:**

- It's okay to be one week ahead instead of three
- It's okay to say "I'm learning alongside you"
- It's okay to adjust as you go

**If numbers are disappointing:**

- 20 paid subscribers = $160/month = SUCCESS
- 50 paid subscribers = $400/month = EXCELLENT
- 100 paid subscribers = $800/month = EXTRAORDINARY

This is not a get-rich scheme. This is teaching something you believe in to people who need it.

## TONIGHT'S SIMPLE VERSION

If you only do 5 things tonight:

1. [ ] Create Substack account
2. [ ] Set up payment ($8/month subscription)
3. [ ] Paste About page content
4. [ ] Upload Week 1 as draft (don't publish yet)
5. [ ] Set launch date for next Monday

That's enough. You can refine everything else over the next few days.

**Start simple. Ship. Improve.**

Just like you're teaching your students to do.
