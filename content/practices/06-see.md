## Overview

This isn't a photo gallery—it's a seeing practice. One image at a time. Three questions that slow you down. The point isn't to collect photos, it's to notice what you notice. Photography is attention made visible; this tool makes that attention explicit.

## What You'll Build

A photo journal where you upload one image and answer three questions about it. A practice of slowing down and really looking at what you captured.

## Steps

### 01. Build the core practice

Create the photo log with the three essential questions.

```prompt
Build me a photo log. I upload one image and answer three questions: "What caught your eye?", "What were you trying to capture?", "What do you see now that you look again?". Save each entry with the date and display as a vertical timeline.
```

> **Tip:** These specific questions are the point. Don't skip them.

### 02. Add your first entry

Pick a recent photo from your camera roll. Not your best photo—just a recent one. Answer the three questions honestly.

### 03. Add date and location

Add context to your entries.

```prompt
Add a date field (default to today) and an optional location field. Show both in the timeline view.
```

### 04. Add tags

Categorize what you notice.

```prompt
Let me add tags to each entry. Show tags as clickable filters. Common tags might be: people, places, light, texture, color.
```

### 05. Add a reflection view

Read your answers like a journal.

```prompt
Add a view that shows just my written answers without the photos. Let me read what I wrote like a journal.
```

### 06. Add random practice

Revisit old entries.

```prompt
Add a "revisit" button that shows me a random old entry. Prompt me to answer the third question again: "What do you see now?"
```

## Additional Prompts

### EXIF data
When you want to remember technical details.
```prompt
Add EXIF data display (camera, lens, settings)
```

### Compare photos
When you want to see relationships between images.
```prompt
Let me compare two photos side by side
```

### Weekly prompt
When you want to direct your attention.
```prompt
Add a weekly prompt: "This week, notice [shadows/color/faces/etc.]"
```

### Export answers
When you want to keep your reflections as writing.
```prompt
Export my answers as a text document
```

## Troubleshooting

### Images are huge and slow
Compress on upload. "Resize images to max 1200px wide."

### EXIF data missing
Phone photos have it; screenshots don't. That's normal.

### Answers feel forced
Start with photos you genuinely find interesting. Boring photos = boring answers.

### Too many entries
That's fine. The practice is in the doing, not the reviewing.

## Reflection

- What patterns do you see in what catches your eye?
- Do your answers change when you look at old entries?
- Are you photographing different things since starting this practice?
- What's the difference between a photo you took and a photo you looked at?

## Extensions

- Add drawing/annotation on photos
- Create monthly "best of" compilations
- Add a photo-a-day challenge mode
- Connect to Apple Photos or Google Photos
- Print a photo book from your entries
