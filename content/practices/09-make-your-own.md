## Overview

Everything until now has been guided. This is you on your own. Build something only you would build. A tool for a problem only you have. The weird idea that doesn't fit any category. This is the point of everything—not to follow tutorials forever, but to make things that matter to you.

## What You'll Build

Whatever you want. No requirements. No templates. Just you and Claude.

## Steps

### 01. What do you wish existed?

Not "what app idea could make money"—what do YOU wish existed? What problem do YOU have that nobody else seems to care about?

### 02. What do you do manually that could be automated?

What repetitive task do you do every day or every week? Not everything should be automated, but what deserves to be?

### 03. What information do you constantly look up?

What do you Google repeatedly? What's in your notes app that you search for often? Could it be at your fingertips instead?

### 04. Start smaller than you think

Whatever your idea is, make it simpler. Then simpler again. The first version should do ONE thing. You can expand later.

> **Tip:** "But what I really want is..." No. Start with the smallest useful version.

### 05. Build it

You know how now. Describe what you want. Test it. Refine it. Make it yours.

### 06. Ship it

Put it somewhere you can use it. Even if it's just on your own computer. A tool that lives only in your imagination isn't a tool.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't have any ideas"
Carry a notebook for a week. Write down every friction point.

### "My idea is too big"
It is. What's the smallest piece that's useful on its own?

### "Someone already built this"
Cool. Build your version anyway. You'll learn something.

### "It's not good enough"
Ship it anyway. Refine later.

## Reflection

- What did you build?
- Why does it matter to you?
- Would you have attempted this before starting this course?
- What will you build next?

## Extensions

- There are no extensions. There's only what you make.
- Share what you built in the community.
- Help someone else build their idea.
