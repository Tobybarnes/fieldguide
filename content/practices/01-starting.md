## Overview

This is your first build. No frameworks, no complexity—just one HTML file that becomes a page about you. The goal isn't perfection. The goal is to see that you can describe something and have it exist. That's the magic we're after. Don't overthink it. Just start.

## What You'll Build

A single-page personal website with your name, a short bio, and links to your email and social profiles. One file. No hosting yet. Just something real.

## Steps

### 01. Open Claude and describe yourself

Start a conversation with Claude and describe what you want.

```prompt
Build me a simple personal webpage. Include my name [YOUR NAME], a one-sentence bio, and links to my email and LinkedIn. Use HTML and CSS in a single file. Keep it minimal and clean.
```

> **Tip:** Replace the placeholder with your actual info. Be specific about what you want to say.

### 02. Save and open it

Copy the code into a file called index.html. Double-click it to open in your browser.

> **Tip:** If you see raw code instead of a page, make sure the file ends in .html not .txt.

### 03. Look at it. Really look.

What do you notice? What feels right? What feels off? This is the most important skill—developing taste by paying attention.

### 04. Ask for one change

Make one request at a time. See the result. Then ask for the next thing.

```prompt
Change the background to a warm off-white color and make the text a dark charcoal instead of pure black.
```

> **Tip:** Make one request at a time. See the result. Then ask for the next thing.

### 05. Make it yours

Change the fonts. Adjust the spacing. Add a photo. Remove things that feel unnecessary. Keep going until it feels like yours.

### 06. Save a copy

Before you close, save a copy somewhere you won't lose it. This is your first build.

## Additional Prompts

### Add a photo
When you want to add a personal touch.
```prompt
Add a simple photo of me. I'll provide the image file.
```

### Icon links
When you want a cleaner, more visual design.
```prompt
Make the links show as icons instead of text
```

### Add containment
When the page feels too open or unstructured.
```prompt
Add a subtle border or shadow to make the content feel more contained
```

### Mobile responsive
When you want to share the link and have it work everywhere.
```prompt
Make the page look good on mobile phones too
```

## Troubleshooting

### Page shows raw code
Make sure file is saved as .html, not .html.txt

### Image doesn't appear
Check that the image file is in the same folder as your HTML file

### Looks different in different browsers
That's normal. Pick one browser for now.

### Layout looks cramped
Ask Claude to "add more whitespace and padding"

## Reflection

- What did you learn about yourself writing your bio?
- What took longer than expected?
- What surprised you about the process?
- Would you share this page with someone?

## Extensions

- Add a dark mode toggle
- Create multiple pages (about, projects, contact)
- Add animation when the page loads
- Put it online (that's Guide 04: Shipping)
