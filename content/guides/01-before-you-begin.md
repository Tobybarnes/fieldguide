You don't need to become a developer. That's not what this is about.

You need to know that when you have an idea—a tool that would make your life easier, a system that fits how you actually think, a thing that doesn't exist yet—you can just make it.

Not to ship. Not to scale. Not to impress anyone. Just to have it. Because you made it. Because it's yours.

This guide is about capability, not credentials. When you're done, you won't call yourself a developer. You'll just be someone who makes what they need.
