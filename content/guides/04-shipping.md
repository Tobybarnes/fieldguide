Shipping means making your thing accessible—to yourself from another device, or to others if you choose.

For personal tools, running locally is often enough. Your thing lives on your computer, you use it when you need it.

To put something online, Vercel makes it simple. Connect your code, click deploy, get a URL. Free for personal projects.

You don't need to ship everything. Some tools are just for you, running on your machine. That's valid. The point isn't to publish—it's to have what you need.

But when you do want to share, know that the path from "works on my computer" to "works on a URL" is shorter than you think.
