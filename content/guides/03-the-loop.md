Everything you build follows the same pattern: Describe → Generate → Test → Refine.

DESCRIBE: Tell Claude what you want. Be specific about what it should do, not how it should work. "I want a page that saves URLs with notes and lets me search them later."

GENERATE: Claude writes the code. Copy it into your text editor. Save the file.

TEST: Run it. Open it in your browser. Click around. Does it do what you wanted?

REFINE: Tell Claude what to fix. "The search isn't finding partial matches" or "Make the save button more obvious." Repeat until it's right.

This loop is your methodology. You'll use it for everything—from simple pages to complex tools. The more you practice, the better you get at describing what you want.
