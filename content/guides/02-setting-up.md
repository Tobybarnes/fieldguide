You need three things: a computer, a Claude subscription, and a text editor.

Claude: Sign up at claude.ai. The Pro plan ($20/month) gives you the access you need. This is your collaborator—the one who writes the code while you direct.

Text Editor: VS Code is free and works great. Download it from code.visualstudio.com. This is where you'll see and manage the code Claude writes.

Terminal: Your computer already has one. On Mac, it's called Terminal. On Windows, use PowerShell. This is how you run what you build.

That's it. No frameworks to learn. No languages to memorize. Just these three tools and you're ready.
