# Why I Built Field Guide

*The personal story behind the course*

---

I've been building things on the internet for 15 years.

At Shopify, I built screenless games. Physical games connected to the internet without screens. I started calm tech initiatives. Trying to make technology less demanding. Less extractive. Less exhausting. I organized gatherings where engineers, designers, and philosophers could talk about technology thoughtfully instead of tactically.

The whole time, I kept meeting the same people.

**People who wanted a different relationship with technology but had no path to get there.**

They avoided coding bootcamps. Too career-focused. They had zero interest in "10x-ing their productivity." Too hustle-culture. No-code platforms felt constraining. Too locked into templates.

They just wanted to understand their tools instead of feeling controlled by them.

For a decade, I had no good answer for these people. Building required learning to code, which meant months or years of study. That barrier was too high for most people who just wanted to make a link catcher or a daily log.

Then Claude arrived.

## The Moment It Clicked

I was helping a friend who wanted to track their vinyl collection. Discogs felt too public. Spreadsheets felt too rigid. They wanted something custom. Their way of organizing. Their fields. Their aesthetic.

Before Claude, I would have said: "I can build this for you, but it'll take me a weekend, and then you'll need me every time you want to change something."

Instead, I said: "Describe what you want. Let's see what Claude builds."

Twenty minutes later, they had a working catalog. Basic, but functional. We refined it for another hour. Added search. Tags. Photos. They could use it immediately.

**But here's what struck me:** they got a tool. And they understood how it worked. The logic. What happens when you click this. Why that field is there. Where the data lives.

They could describe changes they wanted, and Claude would implement them. They had genuine capability. No dependency on me or any developer.

That's when I realized: the barrier dropped. Building is accessible now in a way it never was before.

## The Problem With Existing AI Education

As I started looking at what was being taught, I got frustrated.

Every AI course was about:
- Use this for your job
- Optimize your workflow
- Build marketable skills
- Launch a startup

Nobody was saying: build small tools for yourself. Practice attention. Create personal infrastructure. Take responsibility for your digital life.

The dominant framing was: AI as productivity multiplier. AI as career accelerator. AI as path to wealth.

The vinyl collector wanted a tool that worked how they thought. They had zero interest in launching a catalog startup.

**There was a missing conversation.**

## Finding the Lineage

I started thinking about where Field Guide actually came from.

From something older than Y Combinator or coding bootcamps.

**Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog (1968)** gave people access to tools for self-reliant living. So they could build lives outside conventional systems. Geodesic dome plans. Cybernetics textbooks. Communication technology. Access to what you needed.

**Gary Snyder's Earth House Hold (1969)** talked about "archaic values." Remembering fundamental human capabilities. Tool-making. Place-dwelling. The common work of the tribe. Real work as daily practice.

**Masahiro Mori's The Buddha in the Robot (1974)** saw robotics as spiritual practice. Robots work without ego. Without greed. With perfect selfless devotion. Engineering becomes a way to understand the universe. How we relate to our tools shapes us.

**Jean Boulton's The Dao of Complexity (2024)** argues against Newtonian prediction and control. The world is organic. Constantly in flow. Stability emerges from ongoing interaction. Small acts matter in interconnected systems.

These four traditions converge in Field Guide:

**Self-reliance through tools** (Brand) + **Real work as daily practice** (Snyder) + **Selfless tools that serve completely** (Mori) + **Emergence through iteration** (Boulton) = **Digital infrastructure built with care**

Philosophy made practical through tool-building.

## The Design Language (七つの原則)

Beyond the philosophical lineage, Field Guide needed a design language that embodied these principles.

I found it in Japanese aesthetic philosophy. Seven principles that have guided craftspeople for centuries:

**簡素 (Kanso) / Simplicity:** Everything essential, nothing extra. The site uses three colors. Minimal navigation. Generous whitespace. Each practice builds one tool with clear purpose. No feature creep.

**不均整 (Fukinsei) / Asymmetry:** Balanced irregularity. The two-column layout. Varied spacing. Content that breathes. Your tools work for you.

**渋み (Shibumi) / Subtle Grace:** Understated elegance. Muted palette (taupe, cream, moss, black). Refined typography. Tools that do their job without demanding attention.

**自然 (Shizen) / Naturalness:** No pretense. Honest language. No marketing speak. No artificial urgency. The natural progression from guides to practices to building your own.

**幽玄 (Yūgen) / Profound Grace:** Show more by showing less. You learn by building. Progressive disclosure. The loop teaches more than any explanation could.

**だつぞく (Datsuzoku) / Freedom:** Transcend convention. No traditional course structure. No completion badges. No certificates. Build what you need. When you need it.

**静寂 (Seijaku) / Stillness:** Calm in design. Unhurried pacing. Room to think. No notifications. No gamification. A quiet space to learn and build.

These principles are structural. They shape every decision. From navigation to content pacing to the loop itself.

When Snyder talked about archaic values, this is part of it: design principles refined over centuries, applied to digital tool-building. They work.

## What I'm Leaving Out

I'm leaving out:
- Teaching you to get a developer job
- Helping you launch a startup
- Optimizing your productivity
- Building your personal brand
- Scaling to millions of users

Those are fine goals. They're just different goals.

I'm interested in people who want capability without credentials. Who want to build small, useful things for themselves and their people. Who want to treat technology as practice.

Gary Snyder wrote: "Three-fourths of philosophy and literature is the talk of people trying to convince themselves that they really like the cage they were tricked into entering."

The cage, in tech, is: you must use what's built for you. Subscribe to services. Adapt to platforms. Accept that building is for professionals.

Most people don't question this. They complain about software but don't imagine alternatives.

Field Guide says: you can walk out of that cage. The door is actually open now.

## What I Hope Happens

I built Field Guide for people like my vinyl-collecting friend. People who have a clear idea of what they need but no path to make it.

**If this works**, they'll:
- Build 9 small tools over 13 weeks
- Learn to describe clearly what they want
- Develop taste through iteration
- Practice attention through making
- Take responsibility for their digital infrastructure

More importantly, they'll see technology differently. As something they can shape.

**If this doesn't work**, at least I tried. At least there's one course in the world that says: you can just build small things with care for your actual life. You don't need to optimize or scale or launch.

That felt worth making.

## The Honest Part

I don't know if this will succeed.

Maybe people want the hustle version. Maybe the market for "contemplative AI tool-building" is just me and three other weirdos.

Maybe I'm romanticizing self-reliance. Maybe most people are perfectly happy with subscription software.

Maybe Field Guide is too philosophical for people who want tactics, and too tactical for people who want philosophy.

**But here's what I know:**

When I showed my vinyl-collecting friend their working catalog, they said: "Wait, I built this?"

They understood it was theirs. They described it, shaped it, refined it. It existed because they made it exist.

That moment when someone realizes they have capability they thought they lacked. That's worth pursuing.

Even if it's just a few people. Even if it never scales. Even if it's just one tool that fits one person perfectly.

**That's why I built this.**

## What Happens Next

Week 1 goes live Monday. The first three weeks are free. After that, $24/month for people who want to keep going.

I'll learn alongside everyone. I'll adapt based on what actually happens. I'll probably change things mid-course when I realize my assumptions were wrong.

This is my first time teaching in this format. I've led workshops and given talks, but never a 13-week structured course. I'm figuring it out as I go.

If you're reading this and it resonates, I'm grateful. If it doesn't, that's fine too.

Either way: I built this because it felt necessary. Because I kept meeting people who needed a different entry point. Because the philosophical traditions I care about pointed here.

Now we'll see if it actually helps.
