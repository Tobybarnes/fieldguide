9 practices teaching digital self-reliance through thoughtful tool-building. From the Whole Earth Catalog tradition.

## Product Description

### Access to Tools, 2025

In 1968, Stewart Brand published the Whole Earth Catalog with a simple mission: give people access to tools for self-reliant living.

Today, we face a similar moment with AI. Everyone's supposed to have an opinion about it. Use it for work. Optimize your life with it. Let big platforms decide what it does for you.

**But most people using AI aren't building their own tools—they're renting someone else's vision.**

Field Guide changes that.

### What You'll Build

Over 9 complete practices, you'll create:

**Practice 01: Starting** - Personal Page  
One HTML file. Your name, bio, links. See that you can describe something and have it exist.

**Practice 02: Capture** - Link Catcher  
Your own link database. No algorithm, no recommendations. Just what you saved.

**Practice 03: Remember** - Daily Log  
A simple journal. Text and timestamps. No prompts, no streaks. Just a place to dump thoughts.

**Practice 04: Move** - Training Log  
Track workouts your way. Sets, reps, notes. Your data, your structure.

**Practice 05: Collect** - Record Shelf  
Catalog for your collection (vinyl, books, tools, whatever you collect). Yours to organize.

**Practice 06: See** - Photo Log  
Visual journal with three reflection questions. Photography as attention practice.

**Practice 07: Gather** - Personal Dashboard  
Bring everything together. Your home screen, curated by you.

**Practice 08: Refine** - Revisit + Improve  
Go back to something you use. Make it better based on real friction, not imagined features.

**Practice 09: Make Your Own** - Self-Directed  
Build whatever you want. No template. No requirements. Just you and Claude.

### The Philosophy

Field Guide draws from four traditions:

**Stewart Brand, 1968 - Whole Earth Catalog**  
Access to tools creates self-reliance. If you can get your hands on what you need, you don't require permission to build the life you want.

**Gary Snyder, 1969 - Earth House Hold**  
"As a poet, I hold the most archaic values on earth... the common work of the tribe." Real work is daily practice, not impressive projects.

**Masahiro Mori, 1974 - The Buddha in the Robot**  
Robots work without ego. Claude does the same—no attachment to solutions, no preference for one approach. Just response to clear direction.

**Jean Boulton, 2024 - The Dao of Complexity**  
Stability emerges from iteration, not prediction. Build fast, test in reality, adapt. Understanding comes from doing.

### Who This Is For

You feel pressure to engage with AI but reject the hustle culture that usually comes with it.

You're drawn to maker philosophy and want to understand your tools, not just consume them.

You value self-reliance over convenience.

You'd rather build something imperfect that's yours than use something polished that isn't.

**You don't need to know how to code.** You just need to be willing to start before you're ready.

---

### What Makes This Different

Most AI courses teach you to:
- Use AI for your job
- Optimize productivity  
- Build marketable skills
- Launch startups

**Field Guide teaches you to:**
- Build personal infrastructure
- Create tools that fit how you think
- Practice attention and care
- Take responsibility for your digital life

We're not in the same category.

### From the Creator

I'm Toby Barnes. I spent 15 years at Shopify humanizing technology—building screenless games, calm tech initiatives, organizing philosophy gatherings.

I'm a secret hippie in tech. I meditate. I read Gary Snyder and Stewart Brand. I think about dharma principles.

Field Guide is my attempt to bridge counterculture self-reliance with modern AI capabilities. To teach tool-building as contemplative practice rather than career optimization.

I built this because I kept seeing people who wanted to engage with AI but rejected the startup hustle culture. They needed a different entry point—one grounded in care, attention, and building for themselves rather than markets.

This is that entry point.

### FAQs

**Do I need to know how to code?**  
No. Claude writes the code. You describe what you want, test it, and refine. The course teaches this methodology.

**What if I get stuck?**  
Each practice includes troubleshooting sections for common issues. Plus you can ask Claude for help—it's excellent at debugging.

**Can I build things not in the course?**  
Absolutely. Practice 09 is specifically for self-directed projects. The methodology works for anything you want to build.

**Will these tools work on mobile?**  
Most will work in mobile browsers. Some practices include making tools mobile-responsive.

**Can I share my tools with others?**  
Yes. Guide 04 covers deploying tools online so others can use them.

**What if Claude changes or gets more expensive?**  
The methodology works with any AI that can generate code. The principles are tool-agnostic.

**Is there a community?**  
Not formally. But I encourage sharing what you build and connecting with others who took the course.

**Can I get a refund?**  
Yes, 30 days, no questions asked. If this isn't what you need, just email me.
