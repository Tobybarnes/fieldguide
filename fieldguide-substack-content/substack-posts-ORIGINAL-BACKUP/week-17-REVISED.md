# Week 17: When NOT to Use Multiple Agents

*You've learned when multiple agents make sense, how to structure their outputs, and how to think about them clearly. This week: when one agent is enough.*

---

## The Real Question

Not "How do I orchestrate multiple agents?"

But "Why would I?"

Most building doesn't need multiple agents.

This week is about recognizing false complexity. About not building systems because they're impressive. About knowing when simpler is better.

---

## The Impressive Trap

You've built nine personal tools with one agent. They work.

Now you know about agent teams. You could build:
- A research team (gather agent, analyst agent, writer agent)
- A development team (architect agent, coder agent, tester agent)
- A content team (idea agent, draft agent, editor agent)

These sound professional. Like real teams.

They're also probably unnecessary.

**The question to ask:** Does this complexity serve the work, or does it serve my ego?

If you're building agent teams because they feel sophisticated, stop.

If you're building them because the work genuinely benefits, continue.

Most of the time, it's the first one.

## Iteration vs. Orchestration

Two approaches to complex work:

**Orchestration:**
Spawn multiple agents in parallel or sequence. Coordinate outputs. Synthesize results.

**Iteration:**
Work with one agent. Refine through multiple cycles. Build understanding through the process.

Orchestration is faster when:
- You know exactly what you need
- Tasks are truly independent
- Comparing multiple perspectives adds value

Iteration is better when:
- You're figuring out what you need
- Tasks build on each other
- Understanding develops through the work

**Most work is the second kind.**

---

## The Cost of Coordination

Every time you add an agent, you add:
- Another prompt to write
- Another output to parse
- Another perspective to reconcile
- Coordination overhead

Sometimes this is worth it. Often it's not.

**Example:**

You're writing a blog post about personal tools.

**Orchestration approach:**
- Agent A: Research best practices
- Agent B: Draft structure
- Agent C: Write introduction
- Agent D: Write body
- Agent E: Write conclusion
- Agent F: Edit for voice

Six agents. Multiple steps. Lots of coordination.

**Iteration approach:**
- One agent. Write draft.
- Read it. Notice what's weak.
- Refine. "The introduction is too abstract. Make it concrete."
- Refine again. "Add example from Week 5."
- Refine once more. "Tighten the conclusion."
- Done.

One agent. Multiple iterations. You're thinking through each step.

**The second approach is almost always better for writing.**

Because writing is thinking. Orchestrating six agents outsources the thinking. Iterating with one agent supports your thinking.

---

## When One Agent Is Enough

Most of the time.

**Building a tool:** One agent. Describe it, iterate, refine.

**Writing content:** One agent. Draft, revise, polish.

**Learning something:** One agent. Ask questions, dig deeper, explore tangents.

**Research:** Usually one agent. Only use multiple when you need genuinely competing perspectives, not just thorough coverage.

**Debugging:** Definitely one agent. The back-and-forth is the point.

**Planning:** One agent helps you think. Multiple agents give you reports to read. Which serves thinking better?

## False Complexity Patterns

### Pattern 1: Assembly Line

"Agent A researches, Agent B organizes, Agent C summarizes."

Why this is false complexity:
- One agent can do all three
- Each handoff loses context
- You're not learning during the process

**Better:** One agent researches and organizes. You read and summarize.

### Pattern 2: The Committee

"Three agents review this proposal from different angles."

When this is useful: Genuinely different analytical frameworks (technical, social, systems)

When this is false: Three "reviewers" who basically give the same feedback in different words

**Test:** Would you actually make a different decision based on three reviews vs. one thorough review?

### Pattern 3: The Specialist Team

"Research agent, writing agent, editing agent - each is specialized!"

Why this is false complexity:
- You're not actually summoning different daemons. Same force, different bindings.
- "Specialization" is just context in the invocation
- One daemon with comprehensive instructions works as well as three "specialized" daemons

**Better:** One clear invocation covering research, writing, and editing standards.

Remember from Week 16: You're summoning temporary forces, not building a permanent team. Don't create elaborate daemon hierarchies when one clean summon would work.

### Pattern 4: Parallel for Parallelism's Sake

"Run five agents in parallel to save time."

When this is useful: Five truly independent tasks that would take significant time sequentially

When this is false: Five variations of the same task hoping one will be good

**Test:** Are you actually saving time, or creating work in comparing five outputs?

---

## The One-Agent Test

Before spawning multiple agents, try this:

Build the entire thing with one agent first.

If it works, you're done. Don't add complexity.

If it clearly doesn't work (genuinely need competing perspectives, truly need parallel work), then add agents.

**Most of the time, one agent works.**

---

## Jean Boulton: Organic Complexity

Boulton distinguishes between organic complexity (emerges from actual interactions) and imposed complexity (structure for structure's sake).

Organic complexity in agent work:
- Using multiple perspectives when perspectives genuinely differ
- Parallelizing when sequential would be significantly slower
- Orchestrating when tasks are truly independent

Imposed complexity:
- Building agent "teams" because that's how organizations work
- Creating handoffs because you imagine that's more professional
- Using multiple agents because it feels more thorough

The first serves the work. The second serves the image of professionalism.

---

## Masahiro Mori: Elegant Simplicity

Mori wrote about mechanical efficiency. Every part serves specific function. No wasted motion. No unnecessary complexity.

The most elegant machines are often the simplest.

The most elegant daemon work is usually one clean summoning, iterated.

**Complexity should be necessary, not impressive.**

Week 16 taught you about summoning and banishing. Week 17 teaches you when NOT to summon.

Most of the time, one daemon is enough. Summoning multiple daemons because you can is ego, not craft.

## Review Your 12 Practices

Look back at the 12 practices you've built (Weeks 5-16):

1. Link Catcher (Week 5)
2. Daily Log (Week 6)
3. Workout Tracker (Week 7)
4. Music Collection (Week 8)
5. Photo Journal (Week 9)
6. Dashboard (Week 10)
7. Research Synthesis (Week 14)
8. Multi-Source Analysis (Week 15)
9. Summoning Circle (Week 16)

**Question:** Which of these would genuinely benefit from multiple agents?

Probably only #7 and #8. And even those work fine with one agent if you iterate.

Everything else: One agent is sufficient.

---

## When to Add Agents

Add another agent when:

**1. You need genuinely competing perspectives**

Not "thorough analysis" but "technical analyst vs. social scientist vs. environmental ethicist looking at the same problem."

Different frameworks produce different insights. Comparison reveals tensions.

**2. Tasks are truly independent and time-sensitive**

Three agents researching three completely separate topics for a deadline. Parallel execution saves time.

**3. You're comparing approaches**

Three agents each prototype a different technical solution. Comparing working prototypes is faster than theoretical analysis.

**Those three situations cover maybe 10% of building work.**

The other 90% is one agent, iterated.

---

## The Practice: Recognition

This week has no new practice to build.

Instead: **Reflection on your existing work.**

**Questions:**

1. Which of your 12 practices actually use multiple agents?

2. For those that do: Did multiple agents serve the work, or did you add them because it felt more advanced?

3. For practices that don't: Could you imagine adding agents? Would it actually help?

4. Going forward: What's your default assumption? "I need multiple agents" or "One is probably enough"?

**The practice is developing judgment.**

Knowing when complexity serves the work vs. when it impresses yourself.

This comes from honest assessment, not rules.

## Gary Snyder: Real Work

"Real work is work that needs doing."

Agent orchestration that serves necessary work: Real.

Agent orchestration that demonstrates capability: Theater.

The practice is distinguishing between them.

Not in theory. In your actual building practice.

---

## Buddhist Teaching: Right Effort

Not too tight, not too loose.

Not too much complexity, not too little.

**Too little:** Stubbornly using one agent when three perspectives would actually help

**Too much:** Building agent teams because you can, not because you should

**Right effort:** Matching complexity to actual need

This is the Middle Way applied to building.

## Next Four Weeks: Projects

Weeks 14-17 taught you about working with multiple agents.

Weeks 18-21 shift focus: **From practices to projects.**

Practices are isolated, completable in a week, teach one skill.

Projects integrate multiple practices. They serve real ongoing work. They evolve.

**The shift:**

You've learned to build. You've learned patterns. Now you identify your own patterns and apply them to work that matters.

Week 18: Identifying your classes (reusable patterns)
Week 19: Project planning (building cohesive systems)
Week 20: Maintenance and evolution (when to refine vs. rebuild)
Week 21: Reflection and direction (what's next)

---

## Reflection: On Simplicity and Capability

You now know how to orchestrate multiple agents. This is capability.

The wisdom is knowing when not to.

Capability without judgment leads to over-engineering.
Judgment without capability leads to stagnation.

You need both.

The practice is matching tool to task. Not defaulting to simple. Not defaulting to complex. Seeing clearly what the work requires.

This develops through practice. Through building things that work. Through noticing what was necessary and what was theater.

**The principle:**

Build as simply as possible. Add complexity only when the work demands it.

Most of the time, one agent is enough.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"I feel like I wasted time learning agent orchestration if I shouldn't use it"**
You didn't. Now you understand it. Now you can recognize when it's appropriate. Knowing when NOT to use something requires understanding what it does.

**"But multiple agents is more fun to build"**
Then build it. But know you're building for enjoyment, not necessity. Both are valid. Just be clear which is which.

**"How do I know if I'm over-engineering?"**
If you spend more time managing complexity than doing the actual work, you're over-engineering. If coordination overhead exceeds the benefit, simplify.

**"What if I really do need multiple agents most of the time?"**
Possible. Some work genuinely requires it. But test this. Try building with one agent first. Be honest about whether multiple agents actually made it better or just made it feel more sophisticated.

**"Feels like you're discouraging agent orchestration after teaching it"**
Teaching the skill AND teaching judgment about when to use it. Both matter. Capability without wisdom is just complexity.
