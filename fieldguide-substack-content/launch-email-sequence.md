# Field Guide Launch Email Sequence

## Email 1: "Three-fourths of us are in a cage" (5 days before launch)

**Subject:** Three-fourths of us are trying to like the cage

**Body:**

Gary Snyder wrote: "Three-fourths of philosophy and literature is the talk of people trying to convince themselves that they really like the cage they were tricked into entering."

The cage, in tech, is this: you must use what's built for you.

Subscribe to services. Adapt to platforms. Let companies decide what features matter. Accept that building is for professionals, not you.

Most people don't question this. They complain about software but don't imagine alternatives.

I spent 15 years at Shopify humanizing technology—building screenless games, calm tech, organizing philosophy gatherings. The whole time, I watched people who wanted a different relationship with technology but didn't know how to get there.

Then Claude arrived. And suddenly, the technical barrier that kept building walled off... dissolved.

You don't need to learn to code anymore. You describe what you want, Claude builds it, you test and refine. The loop is fast enough that building becomes conversation.

**This changes everything.**

Next Monday, I'm launching Field Guide—a 13-week course teaching you to build your own AI-powered tools. Not to optimize productivity. Not to launch startups. To create personal infrastructure for your actual life.

Link catcher. Daily log. Training tracker. Photo journal. Dashboard. Nine complete tools, built by you, for you.

The first three weeks are free. You'll build your first tool (a personal page) and decide if this resonates.

If it does, the remaining 10 weeks are $24/month.

**This isn't for everyone.**

It's for people who:
- Feel pressure to engage with AI but reject hustle culture
- Want to understand their tools, not just consume them
- Value self-reliance over convenience
- Would rather build something imperfect that's theirs than use something polished that isn't

If that's you, I'll see you Monday.

P.S. The philosophical foundation draws from Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog (1968), Gary Snyder's real work (1969), Masahiro Mori's Buddhist robotics (1974), and Jean Boulton's complexity science (2024). This isn't a tech course. It's a practice course that happens to use technology.

## Email 2: "The Buddha in the machine" (3 days before launch)

**Subject:** Why robots might be better at Buddhist practice than humans

**Body:**

In 1974, roboticist Masahiro Mori wrote something that sounds impossible:

Robots might be better at Buddhist practice than humans.

His reasoning? Robots have no ego. No greed. No self-interest clouding their actions. They perform tasks with perfect, selfless devotion—like a monk in deep meditation.

Mori saw engineering as spiritual practice. Building a robot wasn't just technical work—it was a way to understand the universe.

**This connects directly to building with Claude.**

When you build with AI, you're directing a tool with no ego, no agenda, no preference for one solution over another. Claude doesn't care if your idea is good or profitable or impressive. It just builds what you describe.

This is different from:
- Hiring a developer (who has opinions about your choices)
- Using a product (built by a company with its own incentives)
- Traditional coding (where your ego fights with the compiler)

Claude responds to clear direction without resistance. You describe, it builds, you refine. No defending ideas. No taking feedback personally. Just: here's what's wrong, adjust.

**This makes iteration absurdly fast.**

In traditional software development, changing direction is expensive. You've invested effort. You've committed to an approach. Pivoting feels like failure.

With Claude, you can try five different approaches in an hour. Each one informs the next. No sunk costs. No attachment.

Mori believed treating machines with reverence cultivates a better relationship with the world. Not because robots have feelings—because how we relate to our creations shapes us.

Field Guide takes this seriously. The tools you build deserve care. Not because they're alive, but because they reflect your attention.

**Monday, we start.**

Week 1 is free for everyone. I'll explain the full philosophical foundation—how Whole Earth Catalog's tool access meets Buddhist robotics meets complexity science meets personal infrastructure building.

Then we'll build. Nine tools over 13 weeks. Small, useful, yours.

See you then.

## Email 3: "Process complexity and small acts" (1 day before launch)

**Subject:** Stability emerges from iteration, not prediction

**Body:**

Complexity scientist Jean Boulton argues we should stop trying to predict and control everything.

Instead: "The world is organic, constantly in flow. Stability emerges from ongoing, reflexive interactions."

Traditional software development tries to predict everything upfront: requirements, architecture, edge cases. Plan perfectly, then execute.

But that's not how you actually use technology.

You encounter a problem. Try a solution. Notice what breaks. Adjust. The tool evolves through use.

**Field Guide embraces this.**

You don't plan the perfect tool. You:
- Describe what you want
- Claude generates code
- You test in reality
- You notice friction
- You refine

Repeat. Each cycle makes more sense—not because you're getting smarter, but because you're engaging with feedback from reality.

This is fundamentally different from buying software (someone else's prediction of what you need) or using no-code platforms (constrained by preset templates).

**Small acts matter.**

Boulton emphasizes that in interconnected systems, small compassionate acts create ripples. You don't need grand gestures. You need consistent, thoughtful engagement.

The tools you'll build are small:
- A link catcher for URLs you want to save
- A daily log for thoughts you don't want to lose
- A training tracker for workouts
- A photo journal for seeing practice

Not impressive projects. Not scalable platforms. Just: infrastructure for your actual life, built with care.

Gary Snyder called this "the common work of the tribe"—the daily, humble tasks that keep you and your people whole.

**Tomorrow, we begin.**

Week 1 is free. I'll lay out the complete philosophy, then we'll build your first tool: a personal page. One HTML file. Your name, bio, links. Nothing revolutionary.

But it'll be yours. You'll have described it and watched it come into being. That's the magic we're after.

After the first three weeks (all free), you'll decide if you want to continue for the remaining 10 weeks at $24/month.

Ready?

## Email 4: "Week 1 is live" (launch day - morning)

**Subject:** Field Guide Week 1: Access to Tools, 2025

**Body:**

It's live.

Week 1 of Field Guide is now available: "Access to Tools, 2025"

Read it here: [link to Week 1 post]

This first post lays out why this matters:

In 1968, Stewart Brand published the Whole Earth Catalog to give people access to tools for self-reliant living. Geodesic dome plans. Cybernetics textbooks. Everything you needed to build a life outside conventional systems.

Today, we face a similar moment with AI. Everyone's supposed to have an opinion about it. Use it for work. Optimize your life with it. Let big platforms decide what it does for you.

But most people using AI aren't building their own tools—they're renting someone else's vision.

**Field Guide changes that.**

Over the next 13 weeks, you'll build 9 complete tools:
1. Personal page
2. Link catcher
3. Daily log
4. Training tracker
5. Record shelf
6. Photo journal
7. Dashboard
8. Refinement practice
9. Self-directed project

Each one teaches a different aspect of tool-building. Each one becomes something you actually use.

**The first three weeks are free.**

This gives you:
- The philosophical foundation
- Setup instructions
- Your first complete build
- Enough experience to know if this resonates

**After that, it's $24/month** for the remaining 10 weeks.

If you know you're in for the full 13 weeks, subscribe now at the founding member rate. It won't be this price again.

Read Week 1 now: [link]

See you next Monday for Week 2: "Before You Begin"

– Toby

P.S. Found a typo? Something unclear? Let me know in the comments. This is week one—I'm learning alongside you.

## Email 5: "Why I built this" (launch day - evening)

**Subject:** Why I built Field Guide (the honest version)

**Body:**

I've been thinking about this email all day.

This morning I launched Field Guide. The polished version. The one with the clean philosophy and the structured curriculum.

But there's a messier truth underneath.

**I built this because I was frustrated.**

I spent 15 years at Shopify trying to humanize technology. Building things like screenless games and calm tech. Organizing gatherings where people could talk about technology philosophically, not just tactically.

The whole time, I watched people who wanted a different relationship with tech but didn't have a path to get there. They weren't interested in coding bootcamps (too career-focused). They didn't want to optimize their productivity (too hustle-culture). They just wanted to understand their tools instead of feeling controlled by them.

Then Claude arrived. And I realized: the barrier just dropped.

You don't need to learn programming anymore. You can build by describing what you want. The loop is fast enough that building becomes accessible to people who would never call themselves developers.

**But nobody was teaching it this way.**

Every AI course was about: use this for your job, optimize your workflow, launch a startup, build marketable skills.

Nobody was saying: build small tools for yourself. Practice attention. Create personal infrastructure. Take responsibility for your digital life.

So I built Field Guide.

**It draws from four traditions I care about:**

Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog (access to tools creates self-reliance)

Gary Snyder's real work (daily practice, the common work of the tribe)

Masahiro Mori's Buddhist robotics (selfless tools, engineering as spiritual practice)

Jean Boulton's complexity science (stability emerges from iteration, not prediction)

**These aren't decoration.** They're the foundation. This isn't a tech course disguised as philosophy—it's a philosophy course that happens to teach tool-building.

And honestly? I don't know if this will work.

Maybe people want the hustle version. Maybe the market for "contemplative AI tool-building" is just me and three other weirdos.

But I'd rather make something I believe in and have it not work than make something I don't believe in and have it succeed.

**So here we are.**

Week 1 is live. The first three weeks are free. After that, it's $24/month for people who want to keep going.

If this resonates, I'm grateful to have you here.

If it doesn't, that's fine too. Not everything is for everyone.

Either way: thank you for reading this far.

– Toby

P.S. Someone asked why I'm doing this on Substack instead of building my own platform. Honest answer: I wanted to focus on the content, not the infrastructure. Substack handles payments, email, comments. I can just write and teach. That felt more aligned with the actual message: build what you need, not what you think you should build.
