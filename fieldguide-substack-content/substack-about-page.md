# About Field Guide

## What This Is

Field Guide teaches you to build your own AI-powered tools using Claude. You're creating personal infrastructure that does exactly what you need. Nothing more.

This is technology as practice. Building as understanding. Tools that serve you completely because they have no agenda except to help you create what you need.

## The Lineage

Field Guide stands in a specific tradition:

**Stewart Brand, 1968 (The Whole Earth Catalog)**
"Access to tools." Brand believed that giving people the right tools and information was revolutionary. If you could get your hands on what you needed, you didn't require permission from institutions to build the life you wanted.

**Gary Snyder, 1969 (Earth House Hold)**
"As a poet, I hold the most archaic values on earth... the common work of the tribe." Snyder argued for returning to fundamental human capabilities: tool-making, place-dwelling, daily practice. Essential, fundamental work.

**Masahiro Mori, 1974 (The Buddha in the Robot)**
Mori observed that robots possess Buddha-nature because they work without ego or greed, performing tasks with perfect, selfless devotion. He treated engineering as spiritual practice. Building to understand the universe.

**Jean Boulton, 2024 (The Dao of Complexity)**
"The world is organic, constantly in flow. Stability emerges from ongoing, reflexive interactions." Boulton argues against Newtonian prediction and control, advocating for process complexity. Understanding through iteration rather than comprehensive planning.

**Field Guide, 2025**
All four traditions combined: Build your own tools through iterative practice, with care and attention, for the real work of your actual life.

## Seven Principles (七つの原則)

Field Guide is shaped by Japanese aesthetic philosophy. Seven principles that have guided craftspeople for centuries:

**簡素 (Kanso) / Simplicity**
Everything essential. Nothing extra. Three tools to start. Minimal interfaces. Clear purpose.

**不均整 (Fukinsei) / Asymmetry**
Balanced irregularity. Purposeful imbalance. Your tools work for you. They don't need to be perfect.

**渋み (Shibumi) / Subtle Grace**
Understated elegance. Muted colors (taupe, cream, moss). Refined typography. Quiet interactions. The design serves. Tools that do their job without fanfare.

**自然 (Shizen) / Naturalness**
No pretense. No artificiality. Progressive learning flow. Natural next steps. Honest language. No marketing speak. No artificial urgency. Clear guidance from start to ship.

**幽玄 (Yūgen) / Profound Grace**
Show more by showing less. You learn by building. Progressive disclosure. Hints before reveals. The loop teaches more than any explanation could.

**だつぞく (Datsuzoku) / Freedom**
Transcend convention. No traditional course structure. No certificates. No badges. Build your own way.

**静寂 (Seijaku) / Stillness**
Calm in design. Generous whitespace. Unhurried pacing. No notifications. No urgency. No gamification.

These aren't decoration. They're how Field Guide works. The calm you feel navigating the site. The focus during building. The lack of pressure to do more than what's needed. That's intentional design. Grounded in centuries of craft tradition.

## What You'll Learn

Over 13 weeks, you'll build 9 complete tools:
- Personal page
- Link catcher
- Daily log
- Training tracker
- Record shelf (catalog for your collection)
- Photo journal
- Personal dashboard
- Plus refinement practice and a self-directed project

Each practice teaches a different aspect of tool-building. Each one becomes something you actually use.

## Who This Is For

You feel pressure to engage with AI but reject the hustle culture that usually comes with it. You're drawn to maker philosophy and want to understand your tools. You value self-reliance over convenience.

You'd rather build something imperfect that's yours than use something polished that isn't.

You don't need to know how to code. You just need to be willing to start before you're ready.

## How It Works

**Weeks 1-3 are free** for everyone. This gives you:
- The philosophical foundation
- Setup instructions and tools
- Your first complete build (a personal page)
- Enough experience to know if this resonates

**Weeks 4-13 require a paid subscription** ($24/month). You get:
- The remaining 8 practices
- Complete methodology (the loop)
- Guide to shipping your tools online
- Full prompt library with 50+ templates
- Community discussion in comments

After the 13-week run completes, the full course will also be available as a one-time purchase on Gumroad for those who prefer self-paced learning.

## What Makes This Different

Most AI courses teach:
- Using AI for your job
- Optimizing productivity
- Building marketable skills
- Launching startups

Field Guide teaches:
- Building personal infrastructure
- Creating tools that fit how you think
- Practicing attention and care
- Taking responsibility for your digital life

Different categories entirely.

## The Philosophy in Practice

**From Snyder:** "The real work is to make the world as real as it is, and to find ourselves as real as we are within it."

The tools you build here are real work. Infrastructure for your actual life. Built with care. One small tool at a time.

**From Mori:** Robots work without ego. Claude does the same. No attachment to its solutions. No preference for one approach over another. It just builds what you describe.

This makes iteration faster. You describe, test, refine. No resistance. No defending ideas. Just response to clear direction.

**From Boulton:** Stability emerges from iteration. You can't plan the perfect tool upfront. But you can build fast, test in reality, and adapt.

The loop (describe, generate, test, refine) embodies this. Each cycle makes more sense. You're engaging with feedback from reality.

**From Brand:** Access to tools creates self-reliance. The Whole Earth Catalog gave people physical tools. Field Guide gives you digital tools. Or more accurately, teaches you to build them yourself.

## What Happens After 13 Weeks

You'll have:
- 9 working tools you actually use
- The capability to build more whenever you need them
- A methodology that applies to any tool you want to create
- Membership in a community of people building thoughtfully

More importantly, you'll see technology differently. As something you can shape.

## About Me

I'm Toby Barnes. I've spent 15 years humanizing technology at Shopify. Building screenless games. Calm tech initiatives. Organizing gatherings at the intersection of technology and philosophy.

I'm what you might call a "secret hippie in tech." I have a meditation practice. I think about dharma principles. I read Gary Snyder and Stewart Brand.

Field Guide is my attempt to bridge counterculture self-reliance with modern AI capabilities. To teach tool-building as contemplative practice rather than career optimization.

I built this because I kept seeing people who wanted to engage with AI but rejected the startup hustle culture that dominates the conversation. They needed a different entry point. One grounded in care, attention, and building for themselves rather than markets.

This is that entry point.
