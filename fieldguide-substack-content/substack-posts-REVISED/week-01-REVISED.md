Welcome to Field Guide. Over the next 13 weeks, I'll teach you to build your own AI-powered tools using Claude. You'll create personal infrastructure that does exactly what you need and nothing more.

This first post is free for everyone. It sets up why this matters and what's different about this moment.

In 1968, Stewart Brand published the first Whole Earth Catalog with a simple mission: give people access to tools. Tools readers could own, understand, and use to build the lives they wanted.

The catalog taught people how to find what they needed to become self-reliant. Geodesic dome plans. Cybernetics textbooks. Portable video recorders. Everything was chosen to help dispersed communities and builders create their own solutions instead of depending on institutions.

Brand believed that access to the right tools was revolutionary. If you could get your hands on the right information and equipment, you could build what you needed.

## The Same Problem, Different Tools

Today we face a similar moment. AI is everywhere, and everyone's supposed to have an opinion about it. Use it for work. Optimize your life with it. Let the big platforms decide what it does for you.

Most people using AI today rent someone else's vision of what AI should do. They use products. Products come with constraints: someone else's features, someone else's pricing, someone else's ideas about what matters.

## What You'll Actually Build

Field Guide teaches you to build your own AI-powered tools using Claude. You create personal infrastructure. Simple, useful utilities that do exactly what you need and nothing more.

A link catcher that saves what you care about without algorithmic recommendations. A daily log that respects your thoughts. A training tracker that works the way you think. A photo journal. A dashboard. Tools that fit how you actually work.

Simple projects. Single-file web pages. HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript. The kind of thing you can understand, modify, iterate on. The kind of thing you own.

## The Lineage

Field Guide stands in a specific tradition:

**Stewart Brand (1968)**: Access to tools for self-reliant living.

**Gary Snyder (1969)**: "The common work of the tribe." Building tools is fundamental human capability. You learn to build tools for the work that keeps you and your people alive and whole.

**Masahiro Mori (1974)**: Engineering as spiritual practice. Robots work with no ego, no agenda. When you build with AI, you direct a tool that has no preference for one solution over another. Claude just builds what you describe. The tool serves the task completely.

**Jean Boulton (2024)**: The world is organic, constantly in flow. Stability emerges from ongoing interaction. You describe → Claude generates → you test → you refine. The tool becomes useful because you responded to what emerged. This is fundamentally different from buying software or traditional coding that tries to predict everything upfront.

## What Changed: Creation Without Programming

Here's what's different from 1968: Claude can write the code. You describe what you want, you see what it builds, you ask it to change things. The loop is fast enough that building becomes a conversation.

This is genuinely new. New like the personal computer was new. A fundamental shift in who gets to create digital tools.

## Digital Self-Sufficiency

The Whole Earth Catalog gave people what they needed to build shelter, grow food, and create communities without depending on industrial systems. Field Guide gives you what you need to build your own digital tools without depending on Big Tech platforms.

You learn to describe what you want clearly. You learn to iterate—make one change, see the result, ask for the next thing. You learn to develop taste by paying attention to what feels right and what feels off.

By the end, you're building with AI. You have a set of working tools. More importantly, you have the capability to make more whenever you need them.

## The Course

Field Guide includes:

- 4 guides walking you through the fundamentals

- 9 hands-on practices, each building a different tool

- A prompt library with 50+ templates

- Troubleshooting for when things break

- Extensions for going further

You'll build: a personal page, link catcher, daily log, training tracker, record shelf, photo log, and dashboard. Each one teaches a different aspect of tool-building. Each one becomes something you actually use.

## Who This Is For

You feel pressure to engage with AI but reject the hustle culture that usually comes with it. You're drawn to maker philosophy and want to understand your tools. You value self-reliance over convenience. You'd rather build something imperfect that's yours than use something polished that belongs to someone else.

You just need to be willing to start before you're ready.

## Access to Tools

Stewart Brand ended the original Whole Earth Catalog in 1971 with a simple message on the back cover: "Stay hungry. Stay foolish."

The tools have changed. The principle remains.
