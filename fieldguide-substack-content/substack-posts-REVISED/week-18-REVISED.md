# Week 18: Identifying Your Classes

*Weeks 1-17 taught you practices. Individual skills. Isolated tools.*

*This week: recognizing the patterns underneath. Your methodology.*

---

## From Practices to Classes

You've built 12 tools. Each one taught you something specific.

Now look across them. What patterns repeat?

**A class isn't a code class.** It's a way of working you return to. A reusable approach.

You don't consciously think "I'm using the link-saving class." You just recognize: "I need to save things with context" and you know how to build that now.

**The shift:**

From "I built nine separate tools" to "I have patterns for building what I need."

From learning isolated practices to understanding your own methodology.

## Stewart Brand: Access to Tools

The Whole Earth Catalog wasn't about specific products. It was about access to capabilities.

Once you know how to build a link catcher, you can build any "save-item-with-metadata" tool. The specific implementation changes. The pattern stays.

Once you understand the loop (describe → generate → test → refine), you can build anything. The specifics change. The method stays.

**Classes are your catalog of capabilities.**

Not a list of tools. A set of patterns you can apply.

---

## What Makes a Class

**1. You've built it more than once**

If you only built it once, it's a practice, not a pattern.

If you've built "save items with notes and search" three times (links, workouts, photos), that's a class. You recognize the pattern.

**2. You can describe the pattern abstractly**

Not "my link catcher" but "tools that collect items with metadata and make them searchable."

Not "my workout tracker" but "tools that log events over time and surface patterns."

The abstraction is the class.

**3. You can apply it to new contexts**

If someone says "I need to track recipes with notes and search by ingredients," you immediately think: "That's the collection-with-metadata pattern. I know how to build that."

You're not starting from scratch. You're applying a pattern.

## Common Classes from Weeks 1-17

Look at your practices. These patterns probably emerged:

**Class 1: Collection + Search**
- Link catcher (URLs + notes)
- Music collection (albums + metadata)
- Photo journal (images + captions)
- Pattern: Save items, add context, search/filter

**Class 2: Time-Series Logging**
- Daily log (text over time)
- Workout tracker (exercises over time)
- Pattern: Log events, show history, identify trends

**Class 3: Aggregation Dashboard**
- Personal dashboard (Week 10)
- Pulls from multiple sources
- Pattern: Display relevant information in one place

**Class 4: Multi-Perspective Analysis**
- Research synthesis (Week 14)
- Multi-source analysis (Week 15)
- Pattern: Gather information from multiple angles, compare, synthesize

**These are your classes.**

Not the specific tools. The reusable patterns underneath.

## Documenting Your Methodology

You've been building for 17 weeks. You have a method now. Even if you haven't named it.

**Your method includes:**

**How you start:**
- What's your first step when you want to build something?
- Do you sketch it? Describe it in words? Start with Claude immediately?

**How you iterate:**
- How many cycles before you call it done?
- What triggers refinement? (bugs, friction, new ideas)
- When do you stop? (good enough, time constraint, loss of interest)

**How you decide what to build:**
- Do you build in response to friction?
- Do you build speculatively?
- Do you wait until you really need it?

**What you value:**
- Simplicity over features?
- Function over aesthetics?
- Personal fit over best practices?

**This is your craft.** Not "the" craft. Yours.

## Exercise: Map Your Patterns

Take 30 minutes. Review your 12 practices.

**Questions:**

1. Which tools feel similar underneath? Group them.

2. For each group: What's the common pattern?

3. Can you name the pattern in one phrase?

4. Could you build a new tool using this pattern in a different context?

**Example:**

Tools: Link catcher, music collection, photo journal

Common pattern: "Items with metadata that I search and filter"

Name: "Personal collections"

New context: Recipe collection, book notes, interesting people I meet

You now have a class. You can build any personal collection tool.

## Project 01: Personal Research System

Not a practice. A project.

**What's the difference?**

Practice: Isolated, completable in a week, teaches one skill
Project: Integrative, evolving, serves ongoing work

**This project combines:**
- Link catcher (Week 5) - Saving sources
- Research synthesis (Week 14) - Multi-perspective analysis
- Your own synthesis process - Making sense of information

**What it does:**

Comprehensive system for deep research on any topic:

1. **Collect phase:** Save links, articles, papers, notes
   - Each with your annotation
   - Tagged by topic
   - Dated

2. **Analyze phase:** Summon agents to analyze from different perspectives
   - Technical analysis
   - Social/cultural analysis
   - Historical context
   - Whatever frameworks matter for your topic

3. **Synthesize phase:** You read all perspectives, identify patterns
   - Write synthesis document
   - Connect to other research
   - Surface open questions

4. **Archive:** Store completed research for future reference
   - Link to sources
   - Your synthesis
   - Date completed

**Why this is a project:**

It's not done in a week. You build it, then use it for real research. It evolves based on what you actually need.

It combines multiple patterns (collection, multi-perspective analysis, synthesis, archiving).

It serves ongoing work, not hypothetical learning.

## Implementation Approach

Don't try to build the perfect research system immediately.

**Start with minimum:**
1. Tool that saves sources with notes
2. Tool that analyzes sources from three perspectives
3. Simple synthesis document template

**Use it for real research:**
Pick something you're actually researching. Not hypothetical.

Use the system. Notice friction. Notice what's missing.

**Iterate based on use:**
- Need better search? Add it.
- Need to connect research projects? Add that.
- Need to export to specific format? Build it.

**The system evolves through use.**

This is how projects work. Not spec-then-build. Build-use-refine continuously.

## When to Build a New Tool vs. Extend Existing

You've built 12 separate practices. For projects, should you keep building separate tools or integrate them?

**Build separate when:**
- Tools serve different contexts (workout tracker doesn't need to integrate with link catcher)
- Integration adds complexity without benefit
- Tools work fine independently

**Integrate when:**
- Tools naturally feed each other (research sources → analysis → synthesis)
- You're constantly switching between them
- Combined view provides value separate tools don't

**For this research project:** Integration makes sense. Research naturally flows from collecting to analyzing to synthesizing.

**For other tools:** Probably stay separate.

Don't integrate for integration's sake. Integrate when the work benefits.

## Gary Snyder: The Common Work

Snyder distinguished between jobs (what you do for money) and work (what needs doing).

Your research system is work. It serves your actual learning and thinking.

Not because someone assigned it. Because you recognized the need through practice.

**This is what Week 18+ is about:**

Moving from practices (assigned, structured) to work (self-directed, necessary).

The course gives you one more example (this research system). After that, you identify your own work and build what serves it.

---

## Buddhist Principle: Right Livelihood

Right Livelihood means work that doesn't cause harm and serves genuine needs.

Building personal tools is Right Livelihood in the digital domain. You're building what serves genuine needs (yours, and potentially others'). Not extractive. Not harmful. Not optimizing engagement.

**The research system serves learning.** Learning about reality. Understanding complexity. Making informed decisions.

This is useful work.

---

## Reflection: From Learning to Building

Weeks 1-13: You were learning to build
Weeks 14-17: You were learning advanced patterns
Week 18+: You're building what matters to you

The practices gave you capability. The projects let you apply capability to work you care about.

**The shift is complete when:**

You stop thinking "I'm taking a course" and start thinking "I'm building my infrastructure."

You stop asking "What should I build next?" and start noticing "I need a tool for this."

You recognize your own patterns and apply them fluidly.

**This week is that transition point.**

---

**Next week:** Project planning. How to structure work without over-planning.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't see clear patterns in my tools"**
Look for functional similarity, not surface similarity. Link catcher and music collection look different but both collect items with metadata. That's the pattern.

**"My patterns feel too general to be useful"**
Good patterns are general. "Collection with search" applies to dozens of use cases. That's what makes it a class, not a specific implementation.

**"Should I rebuild my tools to match the patterns I see?"**
Only if current tools don't work. Don't refactor for elegance. Refactor if pattern recognition reveals a better way to solve the actual problem.

**"Research system feels too complex for my actual needs"**
Build simpler. Start with just collection + notes. Add analysis only if you actually need it. Projects grow based on use, not speculation.

**"What if my patterns are different from the examples?"**
Good. These are YOUR patterns. The examples show what's possible. Your actual patterns come from your actual building practice.
