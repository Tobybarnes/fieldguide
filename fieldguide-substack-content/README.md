## Philosophical Framework

Your complete lineage:

1. **Stewart Brand / Whole Earth Catalog (1968)** - Access to tools creates self-reliance
2. **Gary Snyder / Earth House Hold + The Real Work (1969, 1980)** - Real work, archaic values, daily practice
3. **Masahiro Mori / The Buddha in the Robot (1974)** - Selfless tools, engineering as spiritual practice
4. **Jean Boulton / The Dao of Complexity (2024)** - Process over prediction, small acts matter
5. **Field Guide (2025)** - All four traditions combined into practical action

## Launch Strategy

**Hybrid Model:**
- Start with Substack (weekly releases, $7-10/month subscription)
- After 13 weeks, package as Gumroad course ($49 one-time)
- Substack = live community version with weekly releases
- Gumroad = self-paced archive version

**Pricing:**
- Substack: $24/month (or $240/year (2 months free))
- Gumroad (after Substack run): $49 one-time

## How to Use This Content

1. **Review all 13 posts** - Make any final edits for your voice
2. **Choose philosophical enhancements** - Pick which philosophy resonates and integrate into posts
3. **Set up Substack** - Import your subscriber list if you have one
4. **Schedule posts** - Set up all 13 weeks in advance, or go week-by-week
5. **Launch Week 1 for free** - Drive traffic to it, let people get hooked
6. **Weeks 2-3 stay free** - Build trust, show value
7. **Week 4 paywall** - Convert free readers to paid

## Differentiation

You're NOT competing with:
- AI coding bootcamps (career-focused)
- Productivity courses (optimization-focused)
- No-code platforms (template-constrained)

You're in the tradition of:
- Counterculture self-reliance
- Contemplative technology
- Complexity-aware practice
- Place-based real work

## Next Steps

1. Review and edit posts for your voice
2. Integrate philosophical enhancements where they resonate
3. Set up your Substack
4. Create a simple launch plan
5. Ship Week 1
