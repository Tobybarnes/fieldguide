# Field Guide - Social Media Launch Posts

## Twitter/X Thread (Launch Announcement)

**Tweet 1:**
I just launched Field Guide—a 13-week course teaching you to build your own AI-powered tools.

Not to optimize productivity or launch startups. To create personal infrastructure for your actual life.

First 3 weeks free. Here's why this matters: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Gary Snyder wrote: "Three-fourths of philosophy and literature is the talk of people trying to convince themselves that they really like the cage they were tricked into entering."

The cage in tech: you must use what's built for you. Subscribe to services. Accept defaults.

**Tweet 3:**
But here's what changed:

Claude removed the technical barrier that kept building walled off. You don't need to learn to code anymore.

You describe what you want. Claude builds it. You test and refine.

Building becomes conversation.

**Tweet 4:**
Field Guide teaches you to build 9 tools over 13 weeks:
• Link catcher
• Daily log
• Training tracker
• Record shelf
• Photo journal
• Dashboard
• + refinement practice
• + self-directed project

Small, useful, yours.

**Tweet 5:**
The philosophy draws from:

Stewart Brand (Whole Earth Catalog, 1968) - access to tools
Gary Snyder (Earth House Hold, 1969) - real work, archaic values
Masahiro Mori (Buddha in Robot, 1974) - selfless tools
Jean Boulton (Dao of Complexity, 2024) - process over prediction

**Tweet 6:**
This isn't a tech course. It's a practice course that happens to use technology.

Weeks 1-3 are free (you'll build your first tool).
Weeks 4-13 are $24/month.

For people who reject hustle culture but want to engage with AI thoughtfully.

**Field Guide: Building Personal Infrastructure in the Age of AI**

After 15 years humanizing technology at Shopify, I've launched something different.

Field Guide teaches tool-building as contemplative practice—not career optimization, not productivity hacks, but creating personal infrastructure with care and attention.

**The philosophical foundation:**

• Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog (1968) taught that access to tools creates self-reliance
• Gary Snyder's Earth House Hold (1969) identified "the common work of the tribe"—fundamental human capability
• Masahiro Mori's The Buddha in the Robot (1974) saw engineering as spiritual practice
• Jean Boulton's The Dao of Complexity (2024) shows that stability emerges from iteration, not prediction

**The practical application:**

Over 13 weeks, students build 9 complete tools using Claude AI: link catcher, daily log, training tracker, photo journal, dashboard, and more.

No coding experience required. Just willingness to start before you're ready.

**Who this is for:**

People who feel pressure to engage with AI but reject the startup hustle culture that dominates the conversation. Those who value self-reliance over convenience. Anyone who'd rather build something imperfect that's theirs than use something polished that isn't.

First three weeks are free. After that, $24/month.

This isn't for everyone. But for those it's for, it might be exactly what's needed.

## Instagram Post (Visual + Caption)

**[Image: Simple graphic with "Field Guide" text + Whole Earth Catalog aesthetic globe]**

**Caption:**

Three-fourths of us are trying to convince ourselves we like the cage.

The cage: you must use software built by companies. Adapt to their features. Accept their priorities. Building is for professionals.

I just launched Field Guide—13 weeks teaching you to build your own AI-powered tools.

Not for productivity. Not for profit. For your actual life.

Link catcher. Daily log. Training tracker. Photo journal. Dashboard. Nine small tools, built by you, for you.

Philosophy: Stewart Brand (1968) + Gary Snyder (1969) + Masahiro Mori (1974) + Jean Boulton (2024) = personal infrastructure through thoughtful practice.

First 3 weeks free. Then $24/month.

For people who want self-reliance over convenience.

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Field Guide: Building AI-powered personal tools through the lens of complexity science

**Body:**

I just launched Field Guide, a 13-week course teaching non-developers to build their own tools using Claude AI.

The positioning is unusual: it draws from Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog (1968), Gary Snyder's contemplative work philosophy, Masahiro Mori's Buddhist robotics (1974), and Jean Boulton's recent work on complexity science.

Rather than "use AI for productivity" or "learn to code," it's about personal infrastructure—building small utilities that fit how you actually work, not how productivity culture says you should.

Students build 9 tools: link catcher, daily log, training tracker, record shelf, photo journal, dashboard, plus refinement and self-directed practices.

**Technical approach:**
- Single-file HTML/CSS/JS tools
- localStorage for persistence  
- No frameworks (keeps it simple and portable)
- Iterative methodology: describe → generate → test → refine
- Optional deployment via Vercel for tools that benefit from being online

**Why this might be interesting to HN:**
1. It's applying complexity theory (emergence through iteration vs. prediction/control) to tool-building
2. The philosophical lineage (counterculture self-reliance + Buddhist tech philosophy) is unusual
3. It treats AI as enabler of digital self-sufficiency rather than workplace optimization

First three weeks are free. After that, $24/month subscription model (will also become a $49 one-time purchase after the 13-week run completes).

Not trying to scale to millions. Just looking for people who want a different relationship with technology.

## Reddit Post (r/SideProject or r/MachineLearning)

**Title:** I made a course teaching people to build personal tools with Claude AI (philosophical approach, not hustle culture)

**Body:**

After 15 years humanizing tech at Shopify, I got frustrated watching people who wanted to engage with AI but rejected the optimization/hustle culture that dominates the space.

So I built Field Guide—13 weeks teaching non-coders to build their own tools using Claude.

**What makes it different:**

Rather than "10x your productivity" or "launch a startup," it's grounded in:
- Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog (access to tools = self-reliance)
- Gary Snyder's philosophy of "real work" (daily practice, not impressive projects)  
- Masahiro Mori's Buddhist robotics (tools without ego)
- Jean Boulton's complexity science (iteration over prediction)

**What you actually build:**

9 tools over 13 weeks:
1. Personal page
2. Link catcher
3. Daily log
4. Training tracker  
5. Record shelf (catalog for collections)
6. Photo journal
7. Personal dashboard
8. Refinement practice (improve an existing tool)
9. Self-directed project

All single-file HTML/CSS/JS. localStorage. No frameworks. Optional deployment.

**Methodology:**

Describe → Generate (Claude writes code) → Test → Refine

Fast iteration. No ego attachment. Pattern recognition over feature creep.

**Who it's for:**

People who:
- Want digital self-sufficiency, not career optimization
- Reject hustle culture but want AI capability
- Value building for themselves over building for markets
- Would rather have something imperfect that's theirs

**Pricing:**

First 3 weeks free. Then $24/month. Will become $49 one-time purchase after the 13-week run.

Not trying to be the next big thing. Just offering a different entry point for people who need it.

Week 1 is live: [link]

Feedback welcome. I'm learning as I go.
