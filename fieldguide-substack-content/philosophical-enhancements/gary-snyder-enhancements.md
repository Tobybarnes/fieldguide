# Field Guide Content Enhancements - Gary Snyder's Real Work

## Core Connection: Field Guide IS "Real Work"

Snyder: "The real work is to make the world as real as it is, and to find ourselves as real as we are within it."

Field Guide: Building tools that fit how you actually work, not how productivity culture says you should work. Making digital infrastructure as real as your actual needs.

## For Week 1 (Access to Tools) - New Section

### The Common Work of the Tribe

In 1969, the same year Stewart Brand was assembling the Whole Earth Catalog, poet Gary Snyder published *Earth House Hold*, declaring: "As a poet, I hold the most archaic values on earth... the common work of the tribe."

He wasn't talking about going backward. He was talking about remembering something fundamental: that humans are tool-makers, place-dwellers, community-builders. That the work that matters isn't status or money—it's the work that keeps you and your people alive and whole.

The Whole Earth Catalog gave people tools for this work. Geodesic dome plans. Sustainable farming guides. Communication technology. Access to what you needed to build a life outside conventional systems.

Field Guide does the same thing for digital infrastructure.

You're not learning to code to get a job. You're learning to build tools for the common work of your life. A link catcher because you're drowning in tabs. A training log because fitness apps don't track what matters to you. A photo journal because seeing clearly is practice.

This is archaic in Snyder's sense: fundamental human capability, newly accessible. Not primitive—essential.

## For Week 2 (Before You Begin) - Add This

### Escaping the Cage

Snyder wrote: "Three-fourths of philosophy and literature is the talk of people trying to convince themselves that they really like the cage they were tricked into entering."

The cage, in tech, is: you must use what's built for you. Subscribe to services. Adapt to platforms. Let companies decide what features matter.

Most people accept this. They complain about software, but they don't imagine alternatives. They assume building is for professionals.

Field Guide teaches you to step out of that cage. Not because you're special—because it's actually possible now. Claude removes the technical barrier that kept building walled off.

The cage isn't physical. It's mental. It's believing you can't make what you need.

Snyder spent decades living in the mountains, building his own house, growing food, writing poetry. Self-reliance through skill and attention. He wasn't rejecting civilization—he was choosing which parts to engage with on his own terms.

You can do the same with technology. Build what serves you. Ignore what doesn't. Choose your tools deliberately instead of accepting what's marketed to you.

## For Week 3 (Setting Up + Starting) - Add This

### The Sacredness of Ordinary Work

Snyder: "Such a round of chores is not a set of difficulties we hope to escape from... it is our path."

He's talking about cutting wood, carrying water, tending gardens. The daily work that keeps a household running. Not exciting. Not impressive. Essential.

Building personal tools is the same kind of work.

You're not making something to show off. You're not building a portfolio piece. You're creating infrastructure for your actual life: a way to save links, track workouts, remember what you notice.

This is humble work. That's the point.

The first tool you build (a personal page) is almost embarrassingly simple. One HTML file. Your name, a bio, some links. Nothing revolutionary.

But it's yours. You made it. It exists because you described it and Claude helped you bring it into being.

Snyder would recognize this as real work: taking responsibility for your own needs, one small tool at a time.

---

## For Week 6 (Daily Log) - New Section

### Daily Practice

Snyder kept journals throughout his life—recording observations, thoughts, work done. Not for publication (though they eventually were). For practice.

The daily log you're building serves the same purpose. Not to perform productivity. Not to track metrics. To create a record of what you noticed, what you thought, what happened.

Snyder: "The real work is to make the world as real as it is, and to find ourselves as real as we are within it."

Writing daily makes you real to yourself. You see patterns you wouldn't otherwise notice. You remember what matters. You practice attention.

The tool doesn't make you write—it just makes writing easier. Remove friction, increase practice. Simple as that.

## For Week 10 (Dashboard) - Add This

### Finding Your Place

Snyder: "Find your place on the planet. Dig in, and take responsibility from there."

He means this literally—choose a location, learn it deeply, commit to it. Know the watershed, the weather patterns, the plants and animals. Become native to where you are.

Your dashboard is the digital equivalent. It's your home screen. Your daily starting point. What you see when you open a browser.

Most people's home screen is: whatever Google or their browser decided for them. Generic news. Trending topics. Someone else's idea of what matters.

Your dashboard is: what YOU need to see. The weather where you are. Your tasks. Your links. Maybe a quote that grounds you.

This is taking responsibility for your digital place. Not accepting defaults. Curating what you encounter daily.

Small? Yes. But Snyder's entire philosophy is: small, consistent choices about how you live matter more than grand gestures.

Your dashboard is one of those choices.

## For Week 11 (Shipping) - Add This

### Integration of Perspectives

Snyder: "The mercy of the West has been social revolution; the mercy of the East has been individual insight into the basic self/void. We need both."

When you deploy a tool online, you're choosing between:
- **Western approach:** Scale it, share it, make it public, change the world
- **Eastern approach:** Keep it private, use it yourself, refine through personal practice

Field Guide says: both are valid. Do what serves the tool's purpose.

Some tools should stay local:
- Your journal (private by nature)
- Your training log (personal data)
- Things you're still iterating on

Some tools benefit from being online:
- Your dashboard (access from any device)
- Tools you want to share with specific people
- Things that are more useful with a stable URL

The question isn't "should I ship?" The question is "does shipping serve the tool?"

Don't ship because you think you should. Ship when it makes the tool more useful to you or the people you care about.

## For Week 12 (Refine) - Add This

### The Path of Meditation

Snyder outlined a three-fold path for what he called the "Dharma revolutionary": wisdom, meditation, and morality.

**Wisdom:** Understanding how things work  
**Meditation:** Sustained attention to what is  
**Morality:** Acting in accordance with understanding

Refining a tool follows this pattern:

**Wisdom** → Use the tool consistently, notice patterns, understand what's actually wrong (not just that something feels off)

**Meditation** → Sustained attention to how you interact with the tool, what causes friction, what flows smoothly

**Morality** → Act on what you learned—fix what matters, ignore feature creep, respect the tool's purpose

Most people skip to action without wisdom or attention. They add features randomly. They chase shiny improvements.

The practice is: use, notice, understand, then act. This takes longer but produces better tools.

## For Week 13 (Make Your Own) - New Opening

### The Common Work of Your Tribe

Snyder identified with ancient values—"the common work of the tribe."

What's the common work of your tribe?

Not "tribe" as identity group. Tribe as: the people whose lives intersect with yours. Your household. Your coworkers. Your collaborators. The people you help and who help you.

What work do you share? What problems do you all face? What would make that work easier?

Maybe your tribe needs:
- A way to coordinate schedules
- A shared recipe collection
- A tool for tracking group expenses
- Something else nobody thought to build

This is your prompt: **Build something for the common work of your tribe.**

Not for the market. Not for validation. For the people you actually work alongside.

Snyder spent decades building a community in the mountains. Physical infrastructure: houses, gardens, water systems. Social infrastructure: gatherings, shared meals, collective care.

You're building digital infrastructure for your version of that. Smaller scale, different medium, same principle: create what your people need.

## Marketing Angles

**New taglines:**
- "The common work of the tribe, digitally"
- "Ancient values, modern tools: build what matters"
- "Real work for real needs"
- "Find your place. Build your tools. Take responsibility."

**Enhanced bio:**
Field Guide teaches tool-building as real work—not career development, not side hustles, but the humble daily practice of creating what you need. Drawing from Gary Snyder's archaic values, the Whole Earth Catalog's tool access, and Buddhist robotics philosophy, it's about making the digital world as real as your actual needs.

**Social media hook:**
"Three-fourths of tech discourse is people convincing themselves they like the cage of subscription software. Field Guide teaches you to walk out: build your own tools, own your infrastructure, take responsibility for your digital life."

## Why This Matters

Snyder gives you language for what Field Guide is actually doing:

1. **Archaic values** → Building tools is fundamental human capability
2. **Real work** → Daily infrastructure, not impressive projects
3. **Common work of the tribe** → Build for actual people, not markets
4. **Find your place** → Your dashboard, your tools, your digital home
5. **Daily practice** → Consistency over perfection
6. **Integration** → Personal tools AND shared tools, both valid

This positions Field Guide as part of a 50+ year lineage of practical philosophy about tools, place, and work.

You're not teaching people to code. You're teaching them to take responsibility for their digital infrastructure the way Snyder took responsibility for his physical homestead.

Same principle, different domain.
