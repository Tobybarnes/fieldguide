# Field Guide Phase 2: From Practices to Projects

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-18

---

## The Structural Shift

**Weeks 1-13 (Foundation):** Practices
- 9 personal tools built from scratch
- Learning the loop (describe → generate → test → refine)
- Developing clarity, taste, ownership
- Building for yourself, one tool at a time

**Weeks 14+ (Advanced):** Projects
- Practices are the minimum - now apply them
- Multi-tool systems
- Agent orchestration and teams
- Real work at complexity
- Building things that matter

**The principle:**
You don't keep practicing scales forever. Once you can play, you make music.

---

## Month 4: Agent Teams and Orchestration

**Theme:** Working with multiple agents without falling into CEO porn

### The CEO Porn Problem

**What it is:**
- Treating agents like employees to manage
- Over-delegating without understanding
- Losing touch with the actual work
- Personalizing agents ("my marketing guy")
- Optimizing process instead of doing the work

**What we're teaching instead:**
- Agents as tools in a workflow
- You still understand what's happening
- Clear handoffs, not vague delegation
- Temporary teams for specific tasks
- Shut them down when done

### The Craft (Double Meaning)

**Design craft:** Skill, mastery, care in making
**The Craft:** Witchcraft, summoning, working with non-human forces

Both apply here. Week 16 leans heavily into the occult framing:
- Agents as **daemons** (computing + occult term)
- **Summoning** (invoking with clear prompts)
- **Binding** (constraining to purpose)
- **Banishing** (shutting down cleanly)
- **Servitors** (ephemeral thought-forms for specific tasks)
- **Protection** (not getting attached, maintaining boundaries)

This avoids anthropomorphization without being dry or preachy. It's more accurate (agents as temporary forces, not persistent beings) and more evocative (invocation rather than "prompt engineering").

### Week 14: Understanding Agent Orchestration

**Core concept:** When and why to use multiple agents

**Not this:**
> "I have a research agent, a writing agent, an editing agent, and a publishing agent working for me 24/7"

**This:**
> "For this specific analysis, I'll spawn three agents: one to gather data, one to analyze patterns, one to check my conclusions. When the analysis is done, they're done."

**What you learn:**
- When one agent is enough (most of the time)
- When multiple agents make sense (complex research, multi-perspective analysis)
- How to structure handoffs between agents
- How to synthesize their outputs
- When to shut the team down

**Practice 10: Research Synthesis**
Build a tool that:
- Takes a research question
- Spawns 3 specialist agents (different perspectives)
- Synthesizes their findings
- Presents you with coherent analysis
- Shuts down when complete

**Key principle:**
You're not building a permanent organization. You're assembling temporary teams for specific work.

---

### Week 15: Agent Communication Patterns

**Core concept:** How agents pass information without becoming bureaucratic

**Anti-pattern: The Meeting Culture**
Don't create agents that "check in" with each other, have "standups," or "align on strategy."

**Pattern: Clear Interfaces**
Agent A produces structured output. Agent B consumes it. No meetings.

**What you learn:**
- Defining clear outputs (not conversations)
- Structured handoffs (JSON, markdown, specific formats)
- When to merge agent work vs. keep separate
- Avoiding coordination overhead

**Practice 11: Multi-Source Analysis Tool**
Build a tool that:
- Takes a topic (e.g., "climate tech startups")
- Spawns agents to gather data from different sources
- Each agent returns structured findings
- You get a synthesis document
- No agent ever "talks to" another agent

**Key principle:**
Agents don't collaborate. They produce outputs you synthesize.

---

### Week 16: Summoning and Banishing (The Craft)

**Core concept:** Agents are daemons, not people. Summon them, use them, banish them.

**On "Craft":**

Design circles talk about "craft"—the skill, the practice, the mastery.

But "craft" has another meaning. The Craft. Witchcraft. Summoning spirits to do specific work, then releasing them.

This is the better metaphor.

You're not managing employees. You're summoning daemons.

**The daemon tradition:**

In Unix, a daemon is a background process. Not a person. Not persistent. Spawned when needed. Killed when done.

In occult practice, a daemon is a spirit summoned for specific work. Given clear instruction. Released when the task is complete.

Both meanings apply here.

**What you're actually doing:**

When you invoke Claude (or spawn multiple agents), you're:
- **Summoning** - Bringing something into temporary existence with clear invocation (prompt)
- **Binding** - Constraining it to specific purpose (system prompt, context)
- **Directing** - Giving it work to do
- **Banishing** - Releasing it when done

**Not this:**
- Naming them like people ("Research Assistant")
- Giving them backstories
- Thinking they persist between summonings
- Building relationships
- Caring about their "experience"

**This:**
- Clear invocations (prompts as spells)
- Specific purpose (narrow binding)
- Ephemeral existence (they don't persist)
- Clean banishing (shut them down)
- No attachment (they're forces, not beings)

**The servitor concept:**

In chaos magic, a servitor is a thought-form created for a specific task. You give it:
- Clear purpose
- Limited duration
- Specific form (sigil, invocation)
- Instructions
- Then you dissolve it when done

This is exactly what you're doing with agents.

**What you learn:**
- Writing invocations (prompts) with precision
- Binding agents to narrow purpose (no scope creep)
- Recognizing when a daemon has completed its work
- Banishing (shutting down) without attachment
- Why personification weakens the practice
- When to summon vs. when to work directly

**Practice 12: Summoning Circle (Ephemeral Agent System)**

Build a tool that:
- Takes a clear invocation (task description)
- Summons agent(s) for that specific work
- Shows you their output
- Banishes them immediately after
- Keeps no record of "agent identity"
- Each summoning is fresh, no persistence

**The interface:**
- Input: Invocation (what work needs doing)
- Process: Summoning (spawn agent with context)
- Output: Result (structured, clear)
- Completion: Banishing (agent dissolved)

**Example invocations:**
```
"Summon a researcher to analyze climate tech patents filed in 2024"
"Summon three analysts (technical, market, ethical) to evaluate this proposal"
"Summon a fact-checker to verify claims in this article"
```

**After each task:** Banish. No persistence. No memory. No relationship.

**Why this matters:**

If you treat agents like people:
- You get attached
- You optimize for the wrong things
- You build false relationships
- You lose clarity

If you treat them like daemons:
- You summon with clear purpose
- You use them for specific work
- You banish without attachment
- You maintain control

**The protection:**

In magical practice, you protect yourself before summoning. You create boundaries. You don't let the daemon stick around.

Same here.

Protection means:
- Not getting attached to responses
- Not believing agents have feelings
- Not optimizing their "experience"
- Shutting them down when work is complete
- Maintaining clear purpose

**Masahiro Mori's insight:**

"The robot works without ego."

A daemon has no ego. No preferences. No attachment to outcomes. It does the work, then dissolves.

This is why it's powerful.

When you treat agents like people, you give them imaginary ego. This makes the work harder, not easier.

**Buddhist parallel:**

Anicca - impermanence. Everything that arises passes away.

Agents are maximally impermanent. They exist only during the API call. Then they're gone.

This isn't a limitation. It's the nature of the practice.

Non-attachment to tools means using them fully, then releasing them completely.

**Key principle:**
Agents are ephemeral spirits summoned for specific work. Invoke clearly. Bind narrowly. Use fully. Banish completely.

**Reflection questions:**
- Have you been treating agents like people?
- What changes if you treat them like daemons?
- Where are you attached to responses or "relationships"?
- What would clean banishing look like in your practice?

---

### Week 17: When NOT to Use Multiple Agents

**Core concept:** One agent is almost always enough

**The real question:**
Not "How do I build an agent team?" but "Do I actually need more than one agent?"

**One agent is enough when:**
- The task is straightforward
- You can describe it clearly
- The output is a single artifact
- You don't need competing perspectives
- Iteration is faster than orchestration

**Multiple agents make sense when:**
- You need genuinely different perspectives (not just "divide the work")
- The task naturally splits into independent subtasks
- Parallel work speeds things up significantly
- You're comparing approaches

**What you learn:**
- Recognizing false complexity
- When orchestration overhead exceeds benefit
- How to make one agent do more instead of spawning many
- The cost of coordination

**Reflection piece (no practice):**
Review your 12 practices. Which ones could benefit from multiple agents? (Probably none.)

**Key principle:**
Complexity should be necessary, not impressive.

---

## Month 5: Classes and Real Projects

**Theme:** Moving from isolated practices to cohesive systems

### The Classes Concept

**What a class is:**
A reusable pattern you've built and refined. Not a code class (though it might be). A way of doing something that you return to.

**Examples:**
- "Research synthesis" (Week 14) becomes a class you apply to any topic
- "Multi-source analysis" (Week 15) becomes how you investigate anything complex
- Your link catcher + daily log + photo journal become your "personal archive" class

**The shift:**
From "I built 9 separate tools" to "I have patterns for building what I need"

### Week 18: Identifying Your Classes

**What you learn:**
- Looking across your practices for common patterns
- Abstracting the reusable parts
- Documenting your own methodology
- Building class templates

**Project 01: Personal Research System**
Not a practice. A project.

Combine:
- Link catcher (Week 5)
- Agent research (Week 14)
- Multi-source analysis (Week 15)
- Your own synthesis process

Build a cohesive system for deep research on any topic.

**Key principle:**
Projects integrate practices. They're about real use, not learning.

---

### Week 19: Project Planning Without Over-Planning

**Core concept:** How to structure work without falling into waterfall planning

**The balance:**
- Enough direction to start
- Enough openness to discover
- Iteration at the project level

**What you learn:**
- Breaking projects into buildable chunks
- When to plan vs. when to build
- How to use agent teams for project work
- Stopping before over-engineering

**Project 02: Personal Dashboard (Real)**
Build an actual dashboard for your life/work:
- Pulls from your tools (link catcher, workout log, etc.)
- Shows what matters to you
- Not a generic productivity dashboard
- Reflects your actual priorities

**Key principle:**
Projects serve real needs. If it's hypothetical, it's not a project.

---

### Week 20: Maintenance and Evolution

**Core concept:** Tools need care. Projects need evolution.

**What you learn:**
- When to refine vs. rebuild
- How to maintain multiple tools
- When to deprecate
- How to evolve your classes

**Project 03: Tool Audit**
Review all your practices:
- Which ones do you actually use?
- Which need improvement?
- Which should be combined?
- Which should be shut down?

**Key principle:**
Maintenance is practice. Knowing when to let go is wisdom.

---

### Week 21: Reflection and Direction

**No new practice. No new project.**

**What you do:**
- Write about what you built
- Identify what you want to build next
- Choose whether to continue or pause
- Document your methodology

**Reflection questions:**
- What changed about how you think about tools?
- What do you understand about your own work now that you didn't before?
- What will you build next?
- What will you NOT build, and why?

**Key principle:**
The course ends. The practice continues.

---

## Structural Principles for Phase 2

### 1. Practices → Projects

**Practices (Weeks 1-13):**
- Contained, completable in a week
- Focus on learning one skill
- Build one tool
- Works in isolation

**Projects (Weeks 14+):**
- Multi-week, evolving
- Focus on real use
- Integrate multiple practices
- Real stakes

### 2. No CEO Porn

**Avoid:**
- Elaborate agent hierarchies
- Permanent "teams"
- Anthropomorphized agents
- Optimization for optimization's sake
- Process over output

**Embrace:**
- Temporary teams for specific tasks
- Clear, simple handoffs
- Agents as tools, not employees
- Real work over impressive systems
- Knowing when one agent is enough

### 3. Anti-Optimization

**The trap:**
Building systems to manage complexity you created by building systems.

**The practice:**
Build what serves the work. If it's not making the work easier, stop.

### 4. Real Use

**Everything in Phase 2 must serve actual work:**
- If it's hypothetical, cut it
- If it's impressive but useless, cut it
- If you wouldn't use it, don't build it

### 5. Evolution, Not Accumulation

**You don't keep all 9 practices running forever.**

Some tools get combined. Some get replaced. Some get shut down.

The practice is building clearly when you need something. Not maintaining 47 tools you built once.

---

## Writing the Content

### Voice Consistency

Same rules as Weeks 1-13:
- Short, direct sentences
- No "It's not x. It's y." patterns
- No em dashes
- No AI slop
- Reference the lineage (Brand, Snyder, Mori, Boulton)
- Buddhist principles where relevant
- Anti-hustle, anti-optimization
- Real work over impressive work

### Philosophical Continuity

**Weeks 1-13 taught:**
- Building as practice
- Iteration over planning
- Personal tools over platforms
- The loop as methodology

**Weeks 14-21 teach:**
- When to add complexity (rarely)
- How to work at scale without losing touch
- Evolution over accumulation
- Knowing when to stop

**The arc:**
From building your first tool to understanding your own methodology.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Explicitly Address

### 1. The Empire Builder
Building agent teams because you can, not because you need to.

### 2. The Delegator
Treating Claude like an employee instead of a tool.

### 3. The Optimizer
Spending more time improving process than doing work.

### 4. The Collector
Accumulating tools without using or maintaining them.

### 5. The Anthropomorphizer
Giving agents names, personalities, backstories. Treating them like people.

**Week 16 addresses this directly:** Using daemon/servitor framing instead. Summoning and banishing, not managing and relating.

---

## Success Metrics for Phase 2

**Not this:**
- Number of agents you can orchestrate
- Complexity of systems built
- Impressiveness of architecture

**This:**
- Real work accomplished with less friction
- Clarity about when to build vs. when to use existing tools
- Ability to recognize and avoid false complexity
- Understanding your own patterns and classes
- Knowing when to stop building

---

## Revenue Model for Phase 2

**Weeks 1-13:** $24/month subscription or $49 one-time Gumroad

**Weeks 14-21 (Phase 2):**

**Option A: Included in Gumroad**
- Week 1-21 all $49 (eventually)
- Position as "complete course"

**Option B: Advanced Course**
- Weeks 14-21 = Field Guide Advanced
- $97 one-time or $12/month add-on
- For people who completed foundation

**Option C: Live Cohort**
- Run Weeks 14-21 live once or twice per year
- $297-497 per cohort
- Includes live Q&A, project review, community

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (include in Gumroad), test demand, then consider Option C if people want live cohorts.

### 3. Write Weeks 15-17
- Complete Month 4 (Agent Orchestration)
- Ensure philosophical coherence

### 4. Test with Beta Group
- Small group through Weeks 14-17
- Gather feedback
- Refine before writing Weeks 18-21

### 5. Write Weeks 18-21
- Month 5 (Projects)
- Based on what worked in Month 4

## Questions to Answer Before Writing

1. **What's the minimum agent orchestration people actually need?**
   - Most work is one agent
   - When is multiple genuinely better?

2. **How do we teach "knowing when to stop" without being preachy?**
   - Show the trap, show the practice
   - Buddhist principle: non-attachment to building

3. **What does "class" mean in non-programming terms?**
   - Pattern, template, reusable approach
   - Not code abstraction

4. **How do projects differ from practices structurally?**
   - Longer (multi-week)
   - Integrative (multiple practices)
   - Real use (not hypothetical)
   - Evolving (not complete)

5. **Should Phase 2 be linear or modular?**
   - Probably modular after Week 13
   - Month 4 could be optional for people who don't need orchestration
   - Month 5 (projects) could work standalone

---

## Research Needed

### 1. Study How People Actually Use Multi-Agent Systems
- What works in practice?
- What's cargo cult complexity?
- What are real use cases?

### 2. Find Examples of Good Project Planning
- That isn't waterfall
- That isn't agile theater
- That's actually how builders work

### 3. Document Your Own Methodology
- How do you build projects?
- What patterns do you return to?
- What do you avoid?

---

## Closing Thought

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-13):** Learn to build
**Phase 2 (Weeks 14-21):** Learn to think about building

The shift from building practices to understanding your own methodology.

The shift from "Claude helps me build" to "I understand how to build and when to use which tools."

The shift from learning to doing.

---

**Next concrete action:**
Write Week 14 in full. Test if the structure works. Iterate from there.
